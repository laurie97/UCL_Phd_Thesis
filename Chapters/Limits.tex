\chapter{Di-$b$-jet Search: Limit Setting Phase}
\label{sec:lim}

In Chapter~\ref{sec:bkg} it was shown that there is no evidence of new physics in the dijet mass spectra of the observed di-$b$-jet events
\footnote{Defined as events that pass the di-$b$-jet event selection}. %%%%% This is reference by hand later!!!! Change below if changing this.
However, it is also useful to quantify what this result means in the context
of the signal models that are being searched for.
Specifically, one can estimate the degree of belief that a signal model is true given the di-$b$-jet events that have been observed.
If the degree of belief of a specific model is less than a certain threshold it is concluded that this model is excluded.
This process is known as the limit setting phase.

In this Chapter,
Section~\ref{sec:lim-strat} will describe the limit setting methodology and
Section~\ref{sec:lim-syst} will discuss the systematic uncertainties considered.
Then Sections~\ref{sec:lim-summer}~and~\ref{sec:lim-full} present the details and
the results of the limit setting phase for the \summer{} and \lm{} data-sets respectively.

\section{Limit Setting Methodology}
\label{sec:lim-strat}

In this analysis a Bayesian limit setting approach is used~\cite{lim-bayes}.
To set a limit on a particular model, one considers the hypothesis that the di-$b$-jet events
are produced by a combination of the QCD background and the new physics process.
A background template is produced using the estimation procedures described in the previous chapter
and the BSM physics model is desribed by a dijet mass signal template, normalised such that $\mu$  di-$b$-jet events $^{1}$ are produced.  %%%%% This is a footnote reference. Be careful!!!!
This signal plus background hypothesis is denoted by the symbol $H_\mu$.

Now let us consider this hypothesis in the context of the data, denoted by $D$,
which in this case is one of the observed dijet mass spectra.
For the hypothesis, $H_\mu$, the probability of producing the data is known as the likelihood.
In each dijet mass bin, labelled by the index~$i$, the hypothesis $H_\mu$ predicts
$s_i(\mu)$ signal events, $b_i$ background events and $n_i$ events were observed in data.
Therefore, by only considering statistical uncertainties, the likelihood for a given value of $\mu$ can be calculated using Poisson probabilities:
\begin{equation}
  \Like (\mu,D) = P(D \mid \mu) =  \Pi_i \left(\frac{(s_i(\mu)+b_i)^{n_i}~e^{-(s_i(\mu)+b_i)}}{n_i!}\right)
  \label{eqn:lim-like}
\end{equation}
where the product is over all dijet mass bins and
the notation $P(A \mid B)$ represents the probability of event $A$ occurring
under the assumption of $B$.

\noindent
Then, one can employ Bayes' theorem which states that
\begin{equation}
  P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \, P(A)}{P(B)}
\end{equation}
to obtain the probability density function of $\mu$ given the observed dijet mass spectrum,
\begin{equation}
  P(\mu \mid D) = \frac{ P(D \mid \mu) \, \Pi( \mu ) }{ \Pi( D ) }
  \label{eq:lim-conf_statOnly}
\end{equation}
This quantity, known as the posterior, is an expression of the degree of belief in the hypothesis
$H_\mu$ for any particular value of $\mu$.
The $\Pi( \mu )$ term in the posterior %Equation~\ref{eq:lim-conf_statOnly}
is called the signal prior
and gives the probability density of $\mu$ before the experiment took place.
A prior flat with respect to $\mu$ is chosen
\footnote{Flat from $\mu$ = 0 to the value of $\mu$ where the
likelihood has fallen to $10^{-5}$ of the optimal likelihood value.}
which represents ignorance to the size of the signal.
The $\Pi(D)$ term does not depend on $\mu$ and as such can be considered as a normalisation term.

To accurately represent a true degree of belief in a model one must consider the systematic uncertainties
in the values of $b_i$ and $s_i$ in Equation~\ref{eqn:lim-like}.
The sources of systematic uncertainty considered in this analysis are listed in Section~\ref{sec:lim-syst}.
The systematic uncertainties are incorporated by explicitly considering $s_i$ and $b_i$ as a
function of the parameters which are considered as sources of systematic uncertainty,
the parameters used are known as nuisance parameters.
For example, the number of signal events in a dijet mass bin, $s_i$, is linearly dependant on luminosity ($L$) such that $s_i(L) \propto L$.
Luminosity is a source of systematic uncertainty, so is an example of a nuisance parameter.

Therefore the likelihood becomes a function of the nuisance parameters
\begin{equation}
  \Like (\mu,D,\vec{\theta}) = P(D \mid \mu, \vec{\theta} ) =  \Pi_i \left( \frac{[s_i(\mu,\vec{\theta})+b_i(\vec{\theta})]^{n_i}~e^{-[s_i(\mu,\vec{\theta})+b_i(\vec{\theta})]}}{n_i!} \right)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\theta}$ represents the set of nuisance parameters.

%The effect of the systematic uncertainties are then propagated to the posterior. %Equation~\ref{eq:lim-conf_statOnly}.
A prior probability is introduced for each of the nuisance parameters, given by $\Pi(\vec{\theta})$,
that describes systematic uncertainty on each of the nuisance parameters.
Then, by integrating over the nuisance parameters,
one obtains the posterior for $\mu$ that accounts for systematic uncertainties
\begin{equation}
  P(\mu \mid D) \propto \int d \vec{\theta} \, \Like (\mu, D, \vec{\theta} ) \, \Pi( \mu )  \, \Pi(\vec{\theta})
  \label{eq:lim-conf_syst}
\end{equation}
One can calculate the likelihoods for the data,
perform the integral over nuisance parameters
and then normalise to calculate the probability density of $\mu$
\footnote{This integral is performed using a Markov chain Monte-Carlo using the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit.
 Full details on the implementation can be found here~\cite{det-thesis_kate}.}.

Using the posterior calculated from Equation~\ref{eq:lim-conf_syst},
the 95\% credibility level upper limit of $\mu$, denoted by $\mu_{\,\text{up}}\,$,
is calculated using the expression
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{\mu_{\,\text{up}}} P(\mu \mid D)~=~0.95
\end{equation}
There is a 95\% probability that the parameter $\mu$ lies
within the credibility interval defined as \mbox{$0 \leq \mu < \mu_{\,\text{up}}$}.
Therefore, any model under the hypothesis $H_{\mu}$ that predicts a $\mu$
value above the upper limit, $\mu_{\,\text{up}}$, is excluded at the 95\% credibility level.

In the di-$b$-jet analysis limits are set on the benchmark models for a range of simulated mass points,
%the models and mass points considered
the dijet mass signal templates used are described in Section~\ref{sec:evt-s+b}.
Upper limits are set on the product of cross-section, detector acceptance and tagging efficiency,
$\sigma\,\text{x}\,\mathit{A}\,\text{x}\,\epsilon$,
which is related to the parameter $\mu$ used in the limit setting description
\footnote{
  Specifically $\mu$=$L\,\text{x}\,\sigma\,\text{x}\,\mathit{A}\,\text{x}\,\epsilon$, where $L$ is the luminosity.
}.
$\mathit{A}$ and $\epsilon$ have been measured in Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel-acc} for the benchmark signal models.
%Limits are set on $\sigma\,\text{x}\,\mathit{A}\,\text{x}\,\epsilon$ such that they can be easier reinterpretated
%for other signal models with a similar width to the benchmark models,
%using the measurents of $\epsilon$ and a calculation of acceptance using the event-selection calculated in Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel}.



Further to this many BSM models predicting a narrow resonance
not explicitly considered by this analysis
can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution,
if low-mass off-shell tails and non-perturbative effects are neglected.
Therefore, limits are also set on a signal template with a Gaussian shape,
which can be reinterpreted for a wider range of models.
  
The di-$b$-jet analysis will present two limits.
The first is the observed limit, which is set using the observed dijet mass spectra, as described above.
The second is the expected limit, which is the upper limit that would be set if there is no signal present in the dijet mass spectrum;
the expected limit represents the sensitivity of the limit setting phase.
To calculate the expected limit, the limit setting phase is performed on pseudo-experiments
created by varying the background estimate within the systematic uncertainties.
This process is done for many pseudo-experiments; the median upper limit found gives the expected limit
and the 68\% and 95\% percentiles give the 1 and 2 $\sigma$ uncertainty bands on the expected limit.

In this analysis the Bayesian approach for limit setting is used,
while there is a widely used alternative known as the frequentist approach~\cite{lim-cowan}.
The Bayesian approach defines a credibility interval using the probability (or degree of belief) in a hypothesis given the observed data \mbox{( $P(\mu \mid D)$ )}.
On the other hand, the frequentist approach calculates the probability (or fraction of trials)
of obtaining the data assuming a given signal model is true \mbox{( $P(D \mid \mu)$ )} and rejects models that produce a low probability.
%Bayesian limits are used for two reasons,
%firstly, it has been argued that the Bayesian approach is a more intuitive statistical interpretation of the limits.
%Secondly, the Bayesian approach has been used in other di-jet search analyses at ATLAS~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper}
%which allows for comparable results and shared development of computational framework.
Both approaches are valid and logically consistent,
but it is important that one states clearly which approach is being taken~\footnote{As a side note the BumpHunter $p$-value uses the frequentist approach to calculate a $p$-value.}.

\section{Description of Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:lim-syst}

The sources of systematic uncertainty in the di-$b$-jet analysis are grouped into two categories.
The first group are uncertainties on the dijet mass signal templates used in the limit setting phase, which are produced using Monte-Carlo simulations.
%The systematic uncertainties mostly cover the modelling in of the detector response and signal production.
%modelling of signal production and the response of the detector to signal events in the simulation.

\noindent
The signal systematic uncertainties considered are:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item\textbf{Jet Energy Scale, Jet Energy Resolution  and $b$-Jet Energy Scale} \hspace{1mm} (\textit{Signal}):\\
  Jet energy scale (JES), jet energy resolution (JER) and  $b$-jet energy scale ($b$JES) uncertainties
  represent uncertainties in the energy measurement of a $b$-jet.
  The JES and JER uncertainties used in this analysis were described in Section~\ref{sec:obj-jets_uncert}.
  The ($b$JES) uncertainty used in this analysis has been described in Section~\ref{sec:obj-bjets_bjes}.
  The uncertainties on the jet energy measurement cause an uncertainty on the width of the dijet mass signal templates.\vspace{0.5em}
\item\textbf{$b$-Tagging} \hspace{1mm} (\textit{Signal}):\\
  The modelling of $b$-tagging in Monte-Carlo simulation is calibrated to data using measured $b$-tagging scale factors,
  the scale factors and associated uncertainties are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:obj-bjets_calib}.
  The uncertainty on the $b$-tagging scale factors cause an uncertainty on the normalisation of each bin in the dijet mass signal template.
  %The $b$-tagging systematic uncertainty is large at high values of jet-\pT.%, and as such is the dominant uncertainty in this analysis.
  \vspace{0.5em}
\item\textbf{$b$-Jet Trigger} \hspace{1mm} (\textit{Signal}) - \lm{} data-set only:\\
  Similarly, when using the $b$-jet trigger,
  the modelling of the online $b$-tagging efficiency in simulation is corrected to data using $b$-jet trigger scale factors.
  The $b$-jet trigger scale factors and relevant uncertainties are derived in Section~\ref{sec:trig-bjet_eff}.
  The uncertainty on the $b$-jet trigger scale factors cause an uncertainty on the normalisation of each point in the dijet mass signal template.
  This systematic uncertainty is only used in the \lm{} data-set, as this is the only data-set using a $b$-jet trigger.
  \vspace{0.5em}
  \newpage
\item\textbf{Luminosity} \hspace{1mm} (\textit{Signal}):\\
  The luminosity uncertainty is determined using the methodology outlined in~\cite{lim-syst_lumi}.
  %from van der Meer scans performed in August 2015 and May 2016.
  The luminosity uncertainties used are 2.9\% in the \summer{} data-set and 2.2\% in the \lm{} data-set.
  The uncertainty on luminosity causes an uncertainty on the normalisation of the dijet mass signal template.
  \vspace{0.5em}
\item\textbf{Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) } \hspace{1mm}  (\textit{Signal}):\\
  The PDFs are important in calculating the cross-section of any process at the LHC.
  As shown in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd_pdf} there are uncertainties on the measurements of the PDFs
  which cause an uncertainty on the dijet mass signal template used.
  A flat 1\% uncertainty on the normalisation of the dijet mass signal templates is applied,
  which has been found at previous dijet searches to conservatively cover
  the effect of the PDF uncertainties~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper}.
  \vspace{0.5em}
\end{itemize}

The second group are systematic uncertainties on the background estimation.
As the background estimate is data-driven, the set of uncertainties related to modelling in simulation are not required.

\noindent
The uncertainties on the background estimation model are:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Fit Function Parameters} \hspace{1mm} (\textit{Background}):\\
  The choice of fit parameters is made by maximising the likelihood of the fit function with respect to our data-set.
  However, due to the statistical fluctuations in data the optimal parameters to describe
  the true background shape may not have been chosen.
  To estimate the uncertainty on the choice of parameters,
  the background estimation procedure is performed on pseudo-experiments created by applying Poisson fluctuations to the nominal background estimate.
  The root mean square (rms) of the difference between the nominal background estimate and those from the pseudo-experiments is taken as a symmetric uncertainty. \vspace{0.5em}
\item\textbf{Fit Function Choice}  \hspace{1mm} (\textit{Background}):\\
  A different background estimation can be obtained if a different fit function is chosen.
  To obtain an uncertainty on the choice of fit function an alternate function is considered,
  which is the dijet fit function with one extra degree of freedom than the nominal function.
  The alternate function is then used to fit to the pseudo-experiments described in the previous bullet point.
  The mean of the difference between the nominal and alternate functions is taken as a one-sided uncertainty.
  \vspace{0.5em}
\end{itemize}

\section{\summer{} Data-set Limits}
\label{sec:lim-summer}

Table~\ref{tab:lim-summer_syst} summarises the systematic uncertainties
on the signal templates used in the \summer{} data-set at
three different dijet masses.
Figure~\ref{fig:lim-summer_systBkg} shows the systematic uncertainties on the background estimate
for both $b$-tagging categories as a function of dijet mass.
%Reconstructed mass is defined as invariant mass of the two observed jets.
%$b$-tagging is the dominant systematic uncertainty for the full range of~\mjj.

The observed and expected limits decrease with increasing simulated mass
due to reduced number of background events at higher mass.
The theoretical $\sigma\,\text{x}\,\mathit{A}\,\text{x}\,\epsilon$ predictions
decrease rapidly as mass increases, due to a combination of
lower signal acceptance times efficiency at high mass, as shown in Figures~\ref{fig:evt-ichep_acc},
and a smaller signal cross-section at high mass.
The signal cross-section is smaller at high mass because of PDF and matrix element effects,
similar to those that caused a smaller QCD dijet production at high mass as described in
 Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd-dijet_features}. \textbf{Q for AK: Do I need this para?}

In the mass regions where the theoretical prediction of $\sigma\,\text{x}\,\mathit{A}\,\text{x}\,\epsilon$
is larger than the upper limit, it can be concluded that the model is excluded at the 95\% credibility level.
Using the \summer{} data-set:
the \mbox{$b^*$ quark} is excluded in the mass range of 1.4 - 2.3~TeV,
the SSM $Z'$ boson cannot be excluded,
and the leptophobic $Z'$ boson is excluded at a mass of 1.5~TeV.

To produce generic Gaussian limits,
a signal template with a Gaussian shape in dijet mass is used.
The Gaussian shapes are centred on a range of masses
and the width of the considered Gaussians are
15\%, 10\% and 7\% of the simulated mass
in addition to a Gaussian with the width of the detector mass resolution.
The detector mass resolution has been estimated
at previous dijet searches~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper}
and varies from 3\% at 1.5~TeV to 2\% at~5~TeV.
%The dijet mass resolution is defined as the width of a Gaussian fit to mreco/mtruth
% for matched leading and subleading jets divided by the mean of the Gaussian.
The sources of the systematic uncertainty considered for the Gaussian limits 
are the luminosity uncertainty,
the background modelling uncertainties,
and a 10\% flat uncertainty to account sources for
experimental uncertainties related to signal modelling,
such as jet-energy scale.

Figure~\ref{fig:lim-summer_gauss} shows the observed 95\% credibility upper limits
on the product of cross-section, detector acceptance, tagging efficiency and branching ratio,
$\sigma\,\text{x}\,\mathit{A}\,\text{x}\,\epsilon\,\text{x}\,\mathit{BR}$,
for the full range of Gaussian signals described above in both $b$-tagging categories.
For the \summer{} data-set analysis an upper limit is set on a generic Gaussian signal
ranging from 0.2 to 0.001 pb in the mass range 1.4 to 6~TeV.

\section{\lm{} Data-set Limits}
\label{sec:lim-full}

\subsection{Signal Morphing}
\label{sec:lim-full_morphing}

The limit setting phase requires dijet mass signal templates as an input.
For the \lm{} data-set analysis, simulated dijet mass signal templates of the SSM $Z'$ boson are created at simulated mass points of
600, 800, 1000 and 1250 GeV, as described in Section~\ref{sec:evt-s+b}.
To obtain dijet mass signal templates for intermediate points a signal morphing technique is used,
first implemented in an inclusive dijet search at ATLAS~\cite{dijet-mori17_paper}.

A `Gaussian + reverse Landau' fit is performed to the simulated dijet mass signal templates.
The reverse Landau function is the transformation of the Landau function~\cite{lim-landau} under $x\to-x$.
The Gaussian + reverse Landau fit function is therefore defined as:
\begin{equation}
  f(x)=p_0 \left[ \,p_3\,\mathrm{Gauss}\left(x,p_1,p_2\right)\,+\,\left(\,1-p_3\,\right)\,\mathrm{Landau}\,\left(-x,p_4,p_5\right)\, \right]
\end{equation}
The Gaussian distribution models the convolution of a Breit-Wigner resonance distribution and mass resolution effects.
The reverse Landau distribution provides a description of the off-shell contributions to the dijet mass signal templates which are enhanced at low mass by PDF effects.

\end{figure}

The parameters of the Gaussian + reverse Landau fits are interpolated to produce dijet mass signal templates at intermediary simulated mass points
in the range 600 to 1250 GeV with a separation of 50 GeV \footnote{Explicitly morphed signal templates are created at simulated mass points of 650, 700, 750, 850, 900, 950, 1050, 1100, 1150 and 1200 GeV.}.
Figure~\ref{fig:lim-full_morphing} shows the simulated SSM $Z'$ boson dijet mass signal templates and the intermediate dijet mass signal templates produced using the morphing procedure.
The simulated and morphed signal dijet mass spectra are used as signal templates in the limit setting phase for the \lm{} data-set analysis.


\subsection{Summary of Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:lim-full_systs}

Table~\ref{tab:lim-lowmass_syst} summarises the systematic uncertainties considered for the
signal templates used in the \lm{} data-set at three different dijet masses (\mjj{}).
Figure~\ref{fig:lim-lowmass_syst}(a) shows the total $b$-jet trigger systematic uncertainty as a function of dijet  mass;
this includes both the jet-level and event-level uncertainties described in Section~\ref{sec:trig-bjet_eff}.
Figure~\ref{fig:lim-lowmass_syst}(b) shows the systematic uncertainties on the background estimate as a function of dijet  mass.
%Reconstructed mass is defined as invariant mass of the two observed jets.
%$b$-tagging, $b$-jet trigger and $b$-jet energy scale are the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties at the lowest mass point,
%whilst for the remaining dijet mass range $b$-jet trigger uncertainties are dominant.

\subsection{Signal Subtracted Background Estimation}
\label{sec:lim-full_ssb}

Section~\ref{sec:bkg-full_swift} described the SWiFt background estimation procedure used for the \lm{} data-set,
for clarity this will be referred to as the nominal SWiFt background estimation in this section.
The nominal SWiFt background estimation is model independent meaning that there is no assumption of any signal models in the procedure.
In Section~\ref{sec:bkg-full_signalInj} it was found that there is a signal induced fit bias present when
the nominal SWiFt background estimation is performed on a background-only test data-set with a SSM $Z'$ boson injected.
This was particularly notable for a SSM $Z'$ boson with a simulated mass of 600 GeV,
as this is near the edge of the dijet mass spectrum considered.

To remove any signal induced fit bias in the limit setting phase a Signal Subtracted Background (SSB) estimation is
created for each simulated mass point considered, this technique has been used in a previous inclusive dijet search at ATLAS~\cite{dijet-mori17_paper}.
The signal subtracted background estimate is created by performing two fits;
the first is a signal plus background fit, performed in the SWiFt window
in which the simulated mass of the signal being considered is at the window centre.
The signal is modelled using the dijet mass signal templates described in Section~\ref{sec:lim-full_morphing}
and the background is modelled using the 5 parameter dijet fit function.
The normalisation of the signal template and the parameters of the background function are
chosen to maximise the likelihood (defined in Eqn.~\ref{eqn:lim-like}),
the signal normalisation is required to be greater or equal to zero.
The signal template, normalised by the signal plus background fit, is then subtracted from the data.
Finally, the SWiFt background estimation procedure is performed to the signal subtracted data using the 
5 parameter dijet fit function and a window half-width of 16, the same SWiFt configuration used in the search phase results shown in Section~\ref{sec:bkg-full_results}.
This second background estimation is called the signal subtracted background estimation and is used as the background template in the limit setting phase.
A signal subtracted background estimation is created for each simulated mass point.

To demonstrate that the signal subtracted background estimation will remove the signal induced fit bias,
the procedure is performed to a data-like dijet mass spectrum from the fitting control region when SSM $Z'$ boson dijet mass signal templates are injected.
The same distributions were used in the signal injection studies presented in Section~\ref{sec:bkg-full_signalInj}.
The performance of the signal subtracted background estimation can be compared to that of the nominal SWiFt background estimation.

In Figure~\ref{fig:lim-lowmass_ssb_test}(a) the signal subtracted background~(blue) and nominal SWiFt background~(red) estimations
for a data-like dijet mass spectrum from the fitting control region with a SSM $Z'$ boson injected at 600 GeV are
shown as a ratio to the nominal SWiFt background estimation for the same data-like dijet mass spectrum when no signal is injected (black).
This ratio is used to clearly show any fit biases caused by the injected signal.
The signal injected dijet mass spectrum is shown by the green points and the the grey area represents the the statistical uncertainty of the data.
Figure~\ref{fig:lim-lowmass_ssb_test}(b) shows the same comparison using a SSM $Z'$ boson injected at 1000 GeV.
These two mass points are shown as the signal injection studies, presented in Section~\ref{sec:bkg-full_signalInj},
found that the search phase would not produce a significant observation of a SSM $Z'$ boson at these simulated mass points.

    The simulated mass of the SSM $Z'$ boson is (a) 600 GeV and (b) 1000 GeV.}
  \label{fig:lim-lowmass_ssb_test}
\end{figure}

The nominal SWiFt background estimation has a large signal induced fit bias when a SSM $Z'$ boson is injected,
shown by the fact that the red line is significantly drawn towards the injected signal in Figure~\ref{fig:lim-lowmass_ssb_test}.
The signal induced fit bias is approximately the same size of the injected signal in the case of a SSM $Z'$ boson at 600 GeV.
The signal induced fit bias of the signal subtracted background is small relative to the size of the injected signal,
show by the fact that the blue line lies close to 1 for all dijet masses.
Therefore, the signal subtracted background estimation is used in the limit setting phase, for both the $Z'$ boson and generic Gaussian signals.

Figure~\ref{fig:lim-lowmass_ssb_data} shows the ratio of the 
signal subtracted background (SSB) estimations to the nominal SWiFt background estimate (black) performed on the full \lm{} data-set
\footnote{The SWiFt background estimate for the full data-set is shown in comparison to the data in Figure~\ref{fig:bhFit_lm_unblind}.}.
The grey area represents the parameter choice uncertainty of the nominal SWiFt background estimation.
Signal subtracted background estimations are created for all simulated mass points considered,
but for clarity only those at mass points 600, 800, 1000 and 1250~GeV are shown in the figure.
For all simulated mass points, including those not shown in the figure,
the signal subtracted background estimate is consistent with the nominal SWiFt background estimation
within background uncertainties.
Therefore the results of the limit setting phase would be consistent if either the
signal subtracted or nominal SWiFt background estimation are used.
Furthermore, it can be inferred that there is no signal induced fit bias due to a $Z'$ boson
in the nominal SWiFt background estimation performed to the \lm{} data-set.

    The signal mass points used in the subtracted background estimations are indicated in the legend.}
  \label{fig:lim-lowmass_ssb_data}
\end{figure}

Finally, it is important to note that no signal plus background fit is considered in the search phase result,
as this would mean that the search phase result is not model independent.
However, it is clear that the nominal SWiFt background estimation can be affected by a signal induced fit bias,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lim-lowmass_ssb_test}.
As a result the sensitivity of the search phase is reduced to specific signal models relative to the results of the limit-phase presented below;
the reduced sensitivity is accepted to maintain model independence.

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:lim-full_results}

Figure~\ref{fig:lim-lowmass_benchmark} shows the
95\% credibility level upper limits set on $\sigma\,\text{x}\,\mathit{A}\,\text{x}\,\epsilon$
of a $Z'$ boson as a function of simulated mass.
The observed limit, expected limit and 1 and 2 $\sigma$ uncertainty bands on the expected limit are shown.
Overlaid are theoretical predictions of $\sigma\,\text{x}\,\mathit{A}\,\text{x}\,\epsilon$ for the
Sequential Standard Model (SSM), leptophobic and DM $Z'$ boson benchmark models, which have been described in Section~\ref{sec:evt-s+b}.
These limits have not yet been published so should be considered as preliminary.

Using the \lm{} data-set it is anticipated that the SSM and leptophobic $Z'$ boson
will be excluded in the simulated mass range 0.6 - 1.25~TeV at the 95\% credibility level.
Additionally it is anticipated the DM $Z'$ boson will be excluded in the simulated mass range
0.6 - 0.95~TeV  at the 95\% credibility level.

  \label{fig:lim-lowmass_benchmark}
\end{figure}

For the generic Gaussian limit setting phase there is a significant difference
with respect to the \summer{} data-set analysis.
In the \summer{} data-set analysis a signal template with a Gaussian distribution in dijet mass is used,
whilst for the \lm{} data-set analysis a signal template with a Gaussian distribution in the truth mass distribution is used.
The truth mass is defined as the invariant mass of the leading and subleading truth jets,
using the definition of truth jet from Section~\ref{sec:obj-jets_calib}.
The Gaussian shapes are centred on a range of simulated masses and the width of the considered Gaussians are
15\%, 10\%, 7\%, 5\%, 3\% and 0\% of the simulated mass;
a Gaussian with a 0\% width is a Dirac delta peak.
The transformation of the signal templates from truth mass to dijet mass is performed using
transfer matrices calculated in a Monte-Carlo simulated QCD dijet sample
following the procedure outlined in~\cite{dijet-mori17_paper}.
The Gaussian with a 0\% width in truth mass will have
a width of the mass resolution of the detector in dijet mass.

\newpage
For the Gaussian limit setting the sources of systematic uncertainties
are the luminosity uncertainty,
the background modelling uncertainties and a flat 5\% uncertainty to cover
the JES, JER and $b$JES systematic uncertainties.
Other systematic uncertainties are not included in the preliminary limits,
as these are found to have a small effect on the upper limit relative to the jet energy uncertainties.
This is because the jet energy uncertainties can significantly affect the width of the dijet mass signal template.

Figure~\ref{fig:lim-lowmass_gauss} shows the observed 95\% credibility upper limits set 
on the product of cross-section, detector acceptance, tagging efficiency and branching ratio,
$\sigma\,\text{x}\,\mathit{A}\,\text{x}\,\epsilon\,\text{x}\,\mathit{BR}$,
for the full range of Gaussian signals described above.
The expected limits for a Gaussian signal with a 0\% width
in simulated mass is shown by the dotted lines and associated 1~and~2~$\sigma$ uncertainty bands
are shown in green and yellow.
The results have not yet been published so should be considered as preliminary.

For the \lm{} data-set it is anticipated that an upper limit will be placed
on a generic Gaussian signal ranging from 0.05 to 0.003 pb in the mass range 0.65 to 1.4~TeV.

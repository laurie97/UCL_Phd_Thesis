\chapter{Di-$b$-jet Search: Search Phase}
\label{sec:bkg}

The role of the search phase is to identify if there is any evidence of Beyond Standard Model (BSM)
physics in the form of a resonance (or a bump) in the~\mjj~spectra of the di-$b$-jet events selected.
This is carried out in two parts; firstly a background fit is used to estimate
the~\mjj~distribution of the QCD dijet background.
Then, the difference between the data and the background estimation is used 
to search for a significant excess that would be evidence of BSM physics.

In this chapter I will describe
the details of the $m_{jj}$ spectra used in the analysis (Section~\ref{sec:bkg-mjj}),
the background estimation strategy (Section~\ref{sec:bkg-fit}),
the technique used to search for excesses (Section~\ref{sec:bkg-bh})
and then I will present the search phase validation and results from each of the data sets.

\section{Invariant Dijet Mass Spectrum}
\label{sec:bkg-mjj}

The invariant dijet mass spectrum, or~\mjj~spectrum,
is the distribution of the invariant mass of the leading and subleading jet.
The~\mjj~spectrum is analysed in a binned histogram,
the bin width is chosen to be approximately the same size as the dijet mass resolution
whilst still giving a smooth~\mjj~spectrum~\cite{dijet-mori16_int}.
The exact bins chosen are shown in Appendix~\ref{app:dijet_bins}.

The approach of using~\mjj~is an effective strategy for narrow resonances
where the majority of signal events are found in a few~\mjj~bins,
which can then form a significant excess.
The benchmark models considered for this analysis are examples of narrow resonances.
However, for very wide signals in~\mjj~the signal will cover many bins and is hard to distinguish from the background.
Searches for wide signals in an un-tagged dijet spectrum have been performed using angular distributions~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper}.

There is a different~\mjj~spectrum for each
$b$-tagging category considered,
and an independent search phase will be performed for both.

%Which is defined as;
%begin{equation}
% \mjj = \sqrt{ p^\mu_{L}^2 + p^\mu_{SL}^2 }
%end{equation}
%here $p^\mu_{L}$ and $p^\mu_{SL}^2$ are the four vectors of the leading and su


\section{Background Estimation}
\label{sec:bkg-fit}

Many analyses at ATLAS use Monte-Carlo simulation
to model backgrounds~\cite{obj-Hbb}.
However, simulation is not used to model the
background in the di-$b$-jet search due to three problems;
firstly it is difficult to produce Monte-Carlo simulation at high-enough statistical precision,
secondly there are large theoretical uncertainties for Monte-Carlo QCD
(such as PDF uncertainties and choice of renormalisation scale)
and finally there are large experimental uncertainties affecting
data-simulation comparisons (such as jet energy scale).

Instead, the background is described using a smooth fit function.
This approach utilises the fact that the QCD dijet spectrum
is smoothly falling with respect to~\mjj,
as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd-dijet_features}.
Fit functions have been widely used
in a wide range of searches for resonances on smoothly falling backgrounds
including previous dijet and di-$b$-jet searches~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper,dibjet-mori16_paper,bkg-higgs_gammagamma}.

This approach gives two requirements on a fit function;
firstly the fit function must be able to describe the di-$b$-jet spectrum from QCD,
including any detector or reconstruction effects that could impact the shape such as $b$-tagging.
Secondly,  the fit function used must be constrained enough
such that there is no bias if there is a resonance present in the di-$b$-jet spectrum.
As evidence of such a resonance is found when the data diverges from the fit,
such a bias could reduce the sensitivity to signal.
The fit functions considered in this analysis will be described in the following section.

For any given fit function, 
data is used to determine the parameters of the fit function.
This is done by minimising the negative log likelihood,
where the likelihood is calculated from comparing
the binned data to the fit function
under the assumption of Poisson errors.

\subsection{Dijet Fit Functions}
\label{sec:bkg-bkg_func}

%\begin{equation}
%  f(x)=p_1(1-x)^{p_2}(x)^{p_3+p_4\ln{x}+p_5(\ln{x})^{2}}
%  %p_6(\ln{x})^{3}%},
%\label{eqn:bkg-fit}
%\end{equation}
%where $p_i$ are fit parameters, and $x=m_{jj}/\sqrt{s}$.

%Degrees of freedom can be removed to give a family of dijet fit functions which have a number of parameters ranging from 3 to 6.
%The 3 parameter dijet fit function is defined by setting $p_{i} = 0$ for $i > 3$ in Table~\ref{tab:bkg-fit}
%and the definition is equivalent for the 4 and 5 parameter dijet fit function.
%There is in addition a 6 parameter dijet fit function where $x=m_{jj}/p_6$.

The di-$b$-jet mass spectrum will be described by the dijet fit functions,
which are a family of functions with a varying number of parameters.
The dijet fit functions are listed in Table~\ref{tab:bkg-fit}.

\end{tabular}
\caption{The dijet fit function equations. The fit functions are named by the number of free parameters used. $p_{i}$ are the free parameters of the fit function}
\label{tab:bkg-fit}
\end{table}}

The dijet fit functions are motivated using a theoretical understanding of the QCD dijet production
and experience from previous dijet searches~\cite{theo-dijet_harris}.
The 3 parameter dijet fit function has been used in dijet searches beginning with CDF~\cite{dijet-CDF_3par}
and the three components are motivated as follows:
the $p_1$ term gives the normalisation,
the $(1-x)^{p_2}$ term is a common parameterisation for the behaviour of the PDFs with the property of vanishing as $x$ approaches unity,
and the $x^{p_3}$ term is motivated by the $1/m_{kl}$ term in the matrix element (shown in Equation~\ref{eq:theo-qcd_dijet_xs}).
Additional parameters of $x^{p_4\ln{x}}$ and $x^{p_5\ln{x}^{2}}$ have been considered in dijet searches to give an adequate description of the tail
when large mass ranges are considered~\cite{dijet-CDF_4par,dijet-mori16_int}.
Finally, the $x=m_{jj}/p_6$ term is added as an additional degree of freedom~\cite{det-thesis_kate}.
These functions has been found to provide a satisfactory fit to the leading and next-to-leading-order QCD Monte-Carlo simulation.


The functions with higher number of parameters may be required to describe the di-$b$-jet mass spectrum;
especially in large data-sets where small statistical errors reveal finer details of the QCD background shape
and large mass ranges where larger constraints are applied to the fit in each mass range.
However, additional parameters also allow for more flexibility in the background shape
which might cause a fit bias if a resonance is present.
Hence, there is an overall strategy to use the fewest number of parameters
that can adequately describe the background, such that sensitivity to signal is maximised.

\subsection{Wilks' Statistic}
\label{sec:bkg-bkg_wilks}

To decide whether a fit function has adequate number of parameters the Wilks' test statistic is used,
as done in previous iterations of both the inclusive and $b$-tagged dijet search~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper,dibjet-mori16_paper}.
For this test we consider a null hypothesis that a nominal dijet fit function contains enough parameters to describe the data
and an alternate hypothesis that a dijet fit function with one extra parameter is required.
The Wilks' test statistic is defined as $-\log{(\Lambda)}$, where $\Lambda$ is the likelihood ratio of the nominal and alternate function.
Using Wilks' theorem it is known that for nested functions
\footnote{Nested functions occur when the simpler function can be taken from a more complex function by setting one parameter to a specific value.
  For example the 3 parameter function can be taken from the 4 parameter function when $p_4$ = 0 and so on},
such as the dijet fit functions,
the Wilks' test statistic will follow a $\chi^2$ distribution with 1 degree of freedom~\cite{dibjet-wilks}.
Therefore a $p$-value can be calculated for our null hypotheses that the nominal function has sufficient number of parameters.
Such a $p$-value will be referred to as the Wilks' $p$-value throughout this section.

\section{BumpHunter Algorithm}
\label{sec:bkg-bh}

Once the background has been modelled using a fit, the next step is to determine
if there is evidence of a resonance in the di-$b$-jet invariant mass spectra.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:evt-dijet_schem} such a resonance would appear as a bump on the smoothly falling background distribution.
This can be observed as a discrepant excess in the~\mjj~spectrum;
where an excess is defined as any set of consecutive bins that contains
more events in data than the background prediction,
and discrepant describes how inconsistent an excess is with the background estimation.
To set this up in terms of hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis, $H_0$,
states that there is only QCD dijet events described by our background function,
whilst the alternate hypothesis, $H_1$, proposes that there is also a resonance at some
unknown mass point in the di-$b$-jet spectrum causing a discrepant excess.

Due to statistical fluctuations in the background,
it is expected that excesses will occur in data even if there is no new physics occurring.
Therefore, to claim evidence of a new resonance a significant excess is required,
which is an excess that is highly unlikely to have occurred from such a fluctuation.
To quantify how significant any excess is a $p$-value is used,
where a $p$-value is defined as the probability of finding an excess which is at least as discrepant as the excess found in data
under the assumption of $H_0$.
Hence, a small $p$-value indicates the excess is inconsistent with the null hypothesis and that new physics is present;
in particle physics it is conventional to consider that a $p$-value below $\sim$0.001 (3 \sigma) is considered as evidence of new physics
whilst a $p$-value below 1 in $\sim$3.5 million (5 \sigma) is considered as the discovery of new physics.

In this analysis the {\sc BumpHunter} algorithm~\cite{dibjet-bh} is employed;
this algorithm uses a test-statistic to 
search for the most discrepant excess in our data-set
and calculate the $p$-value of such an excess.
The BumpHunter test statistic gives a quantitative measure of how discrepant any given excess in data is
under the assumption of $H_0$.
To derive the test statistic let's consider $N$ consecutive bins for which
a total of $d$ data events are found and a total of $b$ background events are expected.
As this is a search for excesses we will consider the case where $d > b$.
Using Poisson statistics one can calculate the probability of seeing an excess which is at least that discrepant
under the assumption of the null hypothesis:
\begin{equation}
  P(d,b) = \sum_{n=d}^{\infty} \frac{b^n~e^{-b}}{n!}
\end{equation}
From this probability, the BumpHunter test statistic, $t$, is defined as
\begin{equation}
 t = -\log{\big(P(b,d)\big)}
\end{equation}
The size of the test statistic represents how discrepant an excess is,
with a large $t$ indicating a discrepant excess.
Using the same logic and requiring that $d < b$ it is possible to also search for deficits,
this is referred to as the DeficitHunter $p$-value.

The BumpHunter algorithm calculates the value of $t$ for all excesses in the~\mjj~spectrum
by scanning over all possible combinations of consecutive bins.
The narrowest excess allowed is two bins and the widest excess allowed has half the number of bins in the spectrum.
This excess with the largest BumpHunter test-statistic is the most discrepant excess and the value of $t$ observed is labelled $t_{obs}$.

To calculate the $p$-value of the most discrepant excess
Poisson fluctuations are applied to the background model to create pseudo-experiments,
which are data-like spectra that are consistent with the null hypothesis.
In each pseudo-experiment the BumpHunter scan is performed to find the most discrepant excess and corresponding value of $t$.
This is done for many pseudo-experiments to estimate the probability density function of $t$ under the assumption of the null hypothesis,
which I will label as $f_{PE}(t| H_0)$.
By comparing the observed test-statistic in data, $t_{obs}$,
to the distribution in the pseudo-experiments,
the BumpHunter $p$-value of the most discrepant excess in data is calculated using
\begin{equation}
  \text{BumpHunter}~p\text{-value} = \int_{t_{obs}}^\infty f_{PE}(t | H_0)
\end{equation}

The BumpHunter algorithm is chosen to search for excesses due to two important features.
Firstly, the BumpHunter $p$-value is model independent;
the algorithm makes no prior assumptions about the nature of the new physics model that could be present
other than it would produce extra events and that the extra events would occur in consecutive~\mjj~bins.
%This means that the BumpHunter algorithm is agnostic to the shape of the signal, the width of the signal and the location of the signal.
Secondly, the BumpHunter $p$-value is naturally global;
this means that the $p$-value accounts for the fact that under the null hypothesis an excess such as the one observed could have occurred at any mass point in the~\mjj~spectrum.
This is due to the fact that in the pseudo-experiments there is no prior assumption on the location of the most discrepant excess.

\section{\textit{Summer16+15} Search Phase}
\label{sec:bkg-summer}

This section presents the search phase for the \textit{Summer16+15} data-set.
Section~\ref{sec:bkg-summer_global} describes the background modelling strategy used,
Section~\ref{sec:bkg-summer_fitCR}-\ref{sec:bkg-summer_spusig}
shows studies performed to validate the background modelling strategy
and Section~\ref{sec:bkg-summer_results} presents the results of the search phase.

As described in Chapter~\ref{sec:evt}
there are two $b$-tag categories considered for the \textit{Summer16+15} data-set 
(2 $b$-tag and $\geq1$ $b$-tag)
giving two dijet invariant mass spectra to perform a search phase on.

\subsection{Background Modelling Strategy}
\label{sec:bkg-summer_global}

For the \textit{Summer16+15} data-set the background is modelled using a global fit function,
where a single fit function is used to describe the full mass range of the invariant mass spectra,
similar to previous dijet and di-$b$-jet searches at ATLAS~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper,dibjet-mori16_paper}.

To select a fit function from the set of dijet fit functions described in Table~\ref{tab:bkg-fit} the following strategy is used with the final data-set.
The 3 parameter dijet function is used as the initial nominal function and hence the 4 parameter dijet fit function function is the initial alternate function.
Using the Wilks' statistic a $p$-value can be calculated,
if the $p$-value is less than 0.05, the nominal fit function is rejected and the alternative function becomes the nominal.
The process is iteratively run until a dijet fit function is selected with a stable Wilks' $p$-value.

In the \textit{Summer16+15} data-set the choice of the dijet fit function choice was fixed using the Wilks' p-value calculated for a 8.8~\ifb~subset of data.
This is because it was decided to finalise the function choice before the full data-set was processed and available
such that analysis strategy could be scrutanised by the other members of the ATLAS collaboration in advance of the conference note publication.
%This is because the analysis was being formed as data was being collected and a function choice was required to present the analysis
%to the collaboration .
Figure~\ref{fig:bkg-summer-wilks} shows the Wilks' $p$-value as a function of luminosity
for the $\geq1$ $b$-tag and 2 $b$-tag categories for the 8.8~\ifb~subset of data.
For both categories the 3 parameter fit function when compared to the 4 parameter fit function
has a Wilks' $p$-value $>$ 0.05.
Therefore the 3 parameter fit function is selected in both categories.
Given that the 3 parameter fit function adequately describes the majority of the data-set it is a good assumption that it is able to describe the full data-set.
However, I think with hindsight that it would have been better to calculate Wilks' $p$-value on the full data-set.

\subsection{Fit Tests: Background-Only Data-set}
\label{sec:bkg-summer_fitCR}

To demonstrate that the dijet fit functions are a valid description of the background,
fit tests are performed to a representative background only data-set.

To perform these tests, the {\sc Pythia}8 MC QCD multi-jet simulation is used as the representative background only data-set.
The simulation sample is produced in several slices of leading jet $p_{T}$, where each slice contains the same number of events.
A weight is applied to each event such that the final distribution is representative of the smoothly falling~\mjj~spectrum that is expected,
whilst still maintaining a similar precision across the full mass range.
The weighted invariant mass distribution is then scaled to 10~\ifb~\footnote{
  These studies were carried out during data-taking
  and as such the final integrated luminosity of the data-set had to be estimated,
  10~\ifb was used where the final data-set is 13.3~\ifb.
},
this is referred to as the  `scaled distribution', which can be interpreted as the expected number of data events in a specific mass bin. 
The precision of the scaled distribution is represented by the number of `effective entries';
the number of effective entries is the number of data events that would be required to give the same precision,
or to put it another way it is the square of the error in that mass bin. The number of effective entries can be calculated from the event weights as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:effEnt}.
\begin{equation}
  N_{eff} = (\sum{w_i})^2 / \sum{w_i^2}
  \label{eq:effEnt}
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:effEnt} shows the scaled and effective entries distributions as a function of dijet invariant mass for the 2 $b$-tag and $\geq$1 $b$-tag categories.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Fit Tests: Mass Range Studies}
\label{sec:bkg-summer_range}

The first fit test is to demonstrate that the dijet fit functions are able to describe the~\mjj~spectra.
In this test the search phase procedure is applied to the scaled invariant mass spectra from simulation.
The errors on the invariant mass spectrum are given by the square root of the number of effective entries
which effectively gives the statistical error of the simulated sample.

The dijet mass spectra considered have a lower mass edge of $m_{jj}$ = 1100 GeV,
selected such that there is no kinematic bias from the single jet trigger,
and the upper edge is the mass bin at which the dijet mass spectrum goes below one entry per bin.
Figure~\ref{fig:Short_4para_1100_figure1} and \ref{fig:Short_5para_1100_figure1} show the search phase
for both $b$-tag categories, fitted to with the 4 and 5 parameter fit function respectively.
The most discrepant excess is indicated by the blue lines and the BumpHunter $p$-value of the excess is shown on the plot,
which has been calculated using 10,000 pseudo-experiments.
Similarly, the $p$-value of the most discrepant deficit is calculated using the same process, which is referred to as DeficitHunter,
and an overall quality of fit $p$-value is also calculated by the same process using the $\chi^{2}$ test statistic.
The lower panel shows the significance in each~\mjj~bin,
defined as the difference between the data and the background estimate divided by the error on the data point.

For both fit functions in the $\geq$1 $b$-tag category,
a large excess is observed which has been assigned a BumpHunter $p$-value of 0.00.
This indicates that the 4 and 5 parameter fit functions
provide a poor description of the background distribution from simulation
in the $\geq1$ $b$-tag category.
Note that although these studies have been performed with the 4 and 5 parameter function,
as the 3 parameter function is a subset of the 4 parameter function it can also be concluded
that the 3 parameter function will also be inadequate.

However, by changing the lower mass bound of the fit,
a region can be found where the fit functions are able to describe the background accurately.
To find the largest region with a stable fit quality, the simulated dijet mass spectrum is
fitted to using the 4 parameter function with the lower mass bound of the fit region increased one bin at a time,
beginning at $m_{jj}$ = 1100 GeV up to $m_{jj}$ = 1500 GeV.
As before the upper edge of the fit region is the mass bin at which the simulation goes below one entry per bin.
Figure~\ref{fig:mjjGraphs_bb} and \ref{fig:mjjGraphs_bj_inc} show,
for the 2 $b$-tag and $\geq1$ $b$-tag categories, the distributions of the
(a) BumpHunter, (b) DeficitHunter and (c) $\chi^{2}$ $p$-values as the lower mass bound of the fit region is increased.
In both categories it is shown that there are fit regions that are stable if the lower mass bound is $m_{jj}$ = 1378 GeV or above.
This demonstrates that there are features in the background mass spectrum at low masses that are causing a poor fit quality,
which can be removed by using a fit region $m_{jj} >$ 1378 GeV. 

Figure~\ref{fig:Short_4para_1378_figure1} shows the search phase applied to the dijet mass spectra
of the simulated sample for both $b$-tagging categories,
for the fit range with the lower mass bound of $m_{jj}$ = 1378 GeV,
fitted to using the 4 parameter fit function.
The most discrepant excess, as found by the BumpHunter algorithm, is indicated by the blue lines
and the $p$-value of the excess is shown on the plot.
This shows that the fit quality is reasonable for this choice of fit region.
The study presented in this section motivates the choice of $m_{jj} >$ 1378 GeV
as the lower mass cut used in the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set event selection.

\subsection{Fit Tests: Spurious Signal}
\label{sec:bkg-summer_spusig}

If the true background dijet invariant mass spectrum cannot be described by the chosen fit function,
then fit discrepancies can occur that could appear as false signal or could hide a true signal,
the former is referred to as spurious signal.
To show that fit discrepancies are not occurring, fits are performed to a background-only representative data-set
to demonstrate that the chosen fit function is a valid representation of the true background spectrum.
Similar tests have been performed in previous iterations of both the inclusive and $b$-tagged dijet searches~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper,dibjet-mori16_paper}.

To perform these tests, the scaled distribution from the {\sc Pythia}8 Monte-Carlo multi-jet simulation
described in Section~\ref{sec:bkg-summer_fitCR}
is used as the representative background only data-set.
%In Section~\ref{sec:FitStudies:FitRegion}
%the dijet mass spectrum used took the square root of the
%number of effective entries as the errors.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:effEnt},
the number of effective entries is larger than the number of scaled entries,
meaning that the distribution contains smaller statistical fluctuations than are present in the final data-set.
To create a more representative simulated data-set to test the fit functions,
Poisson fluctuations are applied to the scaled distribution to create a `data-like' distribution.
Figure~\ref{fig:effEntDataLike} shows the scaled and effective entries distributions for both
$b$-tag categories overlaid with a data-like distribution in blue.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

  \end{center}
  \caption{The scaled invariant mass distribution (red) compared to the

    Overlaid is a data-like distribution (blue) created by applying Poisson fluctuations to the scaled distribution.
    The \textit{Summer16+15} data-set event selection has been applied.}
  \label{fig:effEntDataLike}
\end{figure}

The search phase is then applied to the data-like distributions
in both $b$-tag categories 
to test the fit function in a background-only data-set.
Figure~\ref{fig:DataLikeSearchPhase} shows an example data-like distribution for both $b$-tag categories fitted
to with the 3 parameter fit function,
with the most discrepant excess as identified by the BumpHunter algorithm shown.
The $p$-value of the most discrepant excess is calculated by comparing the BumpHunter test statistic in the data-like distribution, $t_{obs}$,
to 10,000 pseudo-experiments; the procedure is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:DataLikeStatPlots_bh}.
Using a similar process, the $p$-value of the most discrepant deficit is calculated using the DeficitHunter test statistic
and an overall quality of fit $p$-value is calculated by the $\chi^{2}$ test statistic.
For this specific set of Poisson fluctuations in the 2 $b$-tag category
the BumpHunter, DeficitHunter and  $\chi^{2}$ $p$-value are found to be
0.57, 0.80 and 0.39 respectively.
Similarly, in the $\geq1$ $b$-tag category the
BumpHunter, DeficitHunter and  $\chi^{2}$ $p$-values are
0.93, 0.77 and 0.86 respectively.
Therefore, the fit is performing well for both $b$-tagging categories for this set of Poisson fluctuations.\\

However, it is required to study the fit quality without being dependant on any one set of Poisson fluctuations.
Therefore, different Poisson fluctuations are applied to the scaled distribution to give many different data-like distributions,
and the search phase can be applied to each data-like distribution.
Figure~\ref{fig:pValueHists_bb} and Figure~\ref{fig:pValueHists_bj} shows the distribution of BumpHunter, DeficitHunter and $\chi^{2}$ $p$-values for 200 different data-like distributions,
for the 2 $b$-tag and $\geq$1 $b$-tag category respectively.
There is no evidence of a fit-bias causing spurious signal in either category,
which could be seen by a bias towards low BumpHunter $p$-values causing fake signals
or a bias toward low DeficitHunter $p$-values causing fake deficits.
The distribution of the $\chi^{2}$ $p$-values also indicates that there is good fit quality in both tagging categories.

Hence, it can be concluded that the 3 parameter fit function is a good description of the simulated QCD background
and that there is no evidence that spurious signal can occur.
Similar tests were performed for the 4 parameter fit function but are not presented here because,
as shown in Section~\ref{sec:bkg-summer_global},
the 3 parameter function is chosen in both categories for this data-set.

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:bkg-summer_results}

It has been shown that the 3 parameter dijet fit function has a
sufficient number of parameters to provide an adequate background
description in both $b$-tagging categories in the fit region that has been chosen
and that there is no evidence that spurious signal can occur.
Hence, for the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set the 3 parameter fit function
provides a valid background estimation in both categories.

Figure~\ref{fig:bkg-summer_searchPhase} shows the final
\verb|Summer16+15| data-set and the background estimate using the 3 parameter dijet fit function
in the 2 and $\geq1$ $b$-tag categories.
The upper panel shows the data compared to the background fit,
in addition the benchmark signal models with enhanced cross sections have been overlaid.
The lower panel shows the significance of the difference between the data and background estimate.

In both cases the BumpHunter algorithm has identified the most discrepant excess indicated
in the figure using vertical blue lines.
The BumpHunter $p$-value has been calculated using 10,000 pseudo-experiments.
The BumpHunter $p$-value is 0.60 in the 2 $b$-tag category
and 0.44 in the $\geq1$ $b$-tag category.
Therefore, it can be concluded that no significant excess is found in either $b$-tag category
and that there is no evidence of new physics in the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set.

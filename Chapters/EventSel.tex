\chapter{Di-$b$-jet Search: Outline and Event Selection}
\label{sec:evt}

In Chapter~\ref{sec:theo} it was shown that many Beyond Standard Model theories
predict new particles decaying to one or two $b$-quarks that could be produced by the LHC.
Chapters~\ref{sec:det},~\ref{sec:obj}~and~\ref{sec:trig}
described the detectors and reconstruction techniques used to observe such an event in the ATLAS detector.
Hence, I have now outlined the motivation and the tools required to perform
a search for resonances decaying to one or two $b$-jets,
an analysis that is called a di-$b$-jet search.

In Chapters~\ref{sec:evt},~\ref{sec:bkg}~and~\ref{sec:lim}
I will describe the di-$b$-jet search analysis using the ATLAS detector.
Each chapter will describe a separate part of the analysis,
the different parts are outlined Section~\ref{sec:evt-outline}.
In this thesis, the di-$b$-jet analysis is performed using three different data-sets,
the data-sets are described in Section~\ref{sec:evt-datasets}.

\section{Analysis Outline}
\label{sec:evt-outline}

The strategy used for the di-$b$-jet analysis
can be split up into three parts,
which form the three di-$b$-jet analysis chapters.
A brief outline of the parts is given here,
and full detail can be found in the relevant chapter.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item\textbf{Di-$b$-jet Event Selection:} (\textit{Chapter~\ref{sec:evt}})\\
  The first step is to select events that are consistent with a resonance decaying to one or two $b$-quarks.
  Briefly, two high-momentum jets are required and two $b$-tag categories are considered;
  a category in which both jets have been $b$-tagged (2 $b$-tag) and a category where at least one jet has been $b$-tagged ($\geq$1 $b$-tag).
  The remainder of the chapter will focus on details of analysis selection;
  Section~\ref{sec:evt-datasets} will describe the data-sets used,
  Section~\ref{sec:evt-s+b} will describe the signal and backgrounds
  considered when defining the selections
  and Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel} will set out
  the details of the event selection used for each of the data-sets.
  \\
\item\textbf{Search Phase:} (\textit{Chapter~\ref{sec:bkg}})\\
  Once events have been selected the next part of the analysis aims to determine if there
  is evidence of a new particle in the selected events; this step is known as the `search phase'.
  This step uses the \mjj~spectrum, where \mjj~is the invariant mass of the two highest~\pT~jets.
  A new particle will appear as a resonance (or `bump') on the smoothly falling background
  \mjj~distribution from QCD multi-jet, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:evt-dijet_schem}.
  A fit function is used to model the smoothly falling QCD background and a
  a model-independent search for for resonances is performed using the BumpHunter algorithm.
  Chapter~\ref{sec:bkg} contains a full description of the search phase strategy.
  %including tests of the fitting functions used and the results of the search phase in the data-sets considered.

          \label{fig:evt-dijet_schem}
  \end{figure}
  \vspace{-4mm}
 
\item\textbf{Limit Setting:} (\textit{Chapter~\ref{sec:lim}})\\
  If, in the search phase stage of the analysis, no significant evidence of signal is
  found then some of the signal models considered may be excluded.
  95\% confidence level limits are set on the two benchmark signals considered.
  Chapter~\ref{sec:lim} presents the limit-setting methodology,
  a description of systematics considered
  and the limit results for each of the data-sets considered.

\end{itemize}

\section{List of Data Sets Used}
\label{sec:evt-datasets}

The di-$b$-jet analysis is performed in several iterations
as data is being collected, where each iteration uses a different data-set.
This is done for two reasons;
firstly it is important to know as soon as possible
if there is evidence of a new resonance as
this would affect the strategy of future di-$b$-jet analyses and that of other analyses at ATLAS.
Secondly, this allows us to incrementally
expand, adapt and improve this strategy in each iteration of the analysis.

In this thesis three different data-sets are considered by the di-$b$-jet analysis.
The overall analysis strategy is the same for each data-set,
so the iterations are described together.
However, there are some significant differences in the details;
as such during the analysis description it will be clearly labelled
which data-set is being referred to.

For any data-set a Good Run List (GRL)
is applied to remove events of low data-quality,
which is typically because an element of the detector was not operating optimally.
For example, data-taking periods where the inner-most layer of the inner detector,
the IBL, was not operating are removed as
this data-taking period has a lower $b$-tagging performance.
A GRL is applied to all data-sets considered in this analysis.

The data-sets are listed below, the trigger used in each data-set is described.
All quoted luminosities are given after the GRL has been applied.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item\textbf{Summer16+15}: \\
  The \verb|Summer16+15| data-set contains 13 TeV $pp$ collision data collected
  between January 2015 to July 2016 which has an integrated luminosity 13.3~\ifb.
  The trigger used in this data-set, known as \verb|HLT_j380|,
  requires a trigger-level jet with $p_T >$ 380 GeV
  \footnote{\label{foot1} Further details of single-jet triggers is in Section~\ref{sec:trig-jet}.}.
  The analysis on this data-set has been published as a conference note~\cite{dibjet-ichep_conf}. \\
  
\item\textbf{Full16+15\_HighMass}:\\
  The \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| data-set contains 13 TeV $pp$ collision data collected
  between January 2015 to December 2016, which has an integrated luminosity of 36.1~\ifb.
  The trigger used in this data-set, known as \verb|HLT_j380|,
  requires a trigger-level jet with $p_T >$ 380 GeV
  \footnote{Again, see  Section~\ref{sec:trig-jet} for details on single-jet triggers.}.
  The analysis on this data-set has yet to be published.\\
  
\item\textbf{Full16\_LowMass}: \\
  The \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set contains 13 TeV $pp$ collision data collected
  between January 2016 to December 2016, which has an integrated luminosity of 24.3~\ifb.
  The trigger used in this data-set is a double $b$-jet trigger 
  which requires two trigger-level jets with $p_T >$ 150 GeV and $p_T >$ 50 GeV
  where both jets have been $b$-tagged at the trigger level
  \footnote{Further details of $b$-jet triggers and this particular trigger used in this analysis is in Section~\ref{sec:trig-bjet}.}.
  The \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set uses a $b$-jet trigger as the lower \pT~thresholds allow
  the analysis to probe a lower range of \mjj.
  This analysis does not include data from 2015 which was collected using a significantly different $b$-jet trigger configuration.
  The \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set uses a $b$-jet trigger aware GRL which additionally
  removes periods of data where the $b$-jet trigger was performing in a sub-optimal way,
  the GRL is described in Section~\ref{sec:trig-grl}.
  As a double $b$-jet trigger is used only the 2 $b$-tag category is considered.
  The analysis on this data-set has yet to be published.

\end{itemize}

\section{Backgrounds and Signal}
\label{sec:evt-s+b}

In the di-$b$-jet analysis selection two
benchmark signal models and one dominant background are considered.
The signal models and dominant background are
used to optimise event selection, so I will describe
the signal and backgrounds considered here.

For both the background and the signal models Monte-Carlo simulation of the processes is produced.
Unless specified, the Monte-Carlo simulation is produced using
the \textsc{Pythia8}~\cite{dibjet-pythia8} program for event generation,
the \textsc{EvtGen} package~\cite{trig-evtGen} to model the decays of the $B$ and $C$ hadrons,
the A14 parameter set~\cite{dibjet-a14} to model the parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event,
and the NNPDF23LO PDF set~\cite{dibjet-nnpdf} to describe the Parton Distribution Function.
The detector response is modelled using the ATLAS detector simulation package~\cite{dijet-sim_ATLAS}.
%The effect of pile-up is modelled by superimposing simulated minimum-bias events
%on the hard-scatter simulation,
%where minimum-bias events are events collected with a loose trigger requirement
%and are dominated by inelastic scattering.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item\textbf{Background: QCD Di-jet}:  \vspace{1em} \\
  Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd} discussed the details of QCD dijet production.
  In particular in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd-dijet_features} it was noted that the
  relative strength of the strong force compared to other forces
  of the Standard Model means that
  QCD dijet production would dominate other backgrounds in a di-$b$-jet event selection.
  Hence, this will be considered as the only background.
  A description of how the QCD dijet background is modelled in this analysis is described in Chapter~\ref{sec:bkg}.
  A simulated QCD dijet sample is also used in this analysis
  for background studies and background modelling validation.
  \end{itemize}

\noindent
Before describing the signal models used it is useful to clearly differentiate between the two definitions of mass used in this analysis.
The invariant dijet mass or reconstructed mass is the invariant mass of the two leading jets, and is denoted by~\mjj.
The simulated mass is the true mass of particle causing a resonance and is defined at the generator level.
The two differ due to detector uncertainties when measuring jet energy.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item\textbf{Signal: $Z'$ Boson}:  \vspace{1em} \\
  The $Z'$ boson is an additional gauge boson that can decay to two $b$-quarks,
  the theoretical $Z'$ boson models considered are
  described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:theo-bsm_zprime}.
  The $Z'$ boson provides a benchmark model in the 2 $b$-tag category.\\
  %in the case that both jets have been $b$-tagged.

  In the \verb|Summer16+15|, \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| and \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set analyses
  the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) $Z'$ and the leptophobic $Z'$ models are considered.
  The intrinsic width of the $Z'$ boson has been set to 3\% of the simulated mass.
  Monte-Carlo simulation is used to produce \mjj~signal templates at leading order (LO).
  Only decays to $b\bar{b}$ are simulated;
  other decays of the  $Z'$ boson are ignored such that our
  results are easier to interpret for other signal models decaying to pairs of $b$-quarks.
  It has been shown that for a $Z'$-boson model the cross-sections can increase by up to 30\%
  from the addition of next-to-leading order (NLO) diagrams~\cite{evt-NLO_zprime}.
  Therefore the signal template normalisation is corrected to account for NLO effects,
  the correction factors have been derived by comparing
  the LO and NLO matrix calculations performed using the \textsc{MadGraph} generator~\cite{dibjet-madGraph}
  and are found to be between 1.2 and 1.3 depending on the signal mass.
  Simulated SSM and leptophobic $Z'$ boson templates are produced at simulated mass points of
  600, 800, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000 and 5000 GeV.\\
  
  Further to this, for the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| and \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-sets
  the Dark Matter mediator $Z'$ boson is also considered.
  For this model the $Z'$ boson signal generation is performed at next-to-leading order using the \textsc{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO} generator~\cite{dibjet-madGraph_NLO},
  whilst all other aspects of event modelling, including parton shower and hadronisation, are performed using the configuration with \textsc{Pythia8} as described above.
  The coupling of the $Z'$ boson to the Dark Matter fermion ($g_{DM}$) is set to 1 and
  the mass of the Dark Matter fermion is 10 TeV,
  the large mass means that decays to the Dark Matter fermion are supressed.
  For the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set the coupling to quarks ($g_{SM}$) is set to 0.1,
  decays to $b$, $c$ and light flavour quarks are considered,
  and the simulated mass points are 600, 800 and 1000 GeV.
  This configuration is chosen to be consistent with recomendations in~\cite{theo_bsm-zprime_dm},
  and to be consistent with other dijet searches at ATLAS~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper}.
  For the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| data-set the coupling to quarks ($g_{SM}$) is set to 0.25
  and the simulated mass points are 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000 and 5000~GeV.
  The larger $g_{SM}$ value is chosen as larger cross-sections are required to set limits at high mass.
  For the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| data-set only decays to $b$-quarks are considered
  as this allows for a greater number of simulated $Z' \to b\bar{b}$ events
  \footnote{This is required as the signal acceptance is lower at high mass, which will be shown in Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel-acc}.}.\\
  
  %Similarly the same models are considered in the \verb|Full16+15_LowMass|... \\

\item\textbf{Signal: $b^*$ Quark}:  \vspace{1em} \\ 
  The $b^*$ quark is the third generation excited quark which results from
  quark compositeness models.
  The dominant decay mode of the  $b^*$ quark is to $bg$.
  The model considered is
  described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:theo-bsm_bstar}.
  The $b^*$ quark provides a benchmark model in the $\geq$1~$b$-tag category.\\
  %case that at least one of the jets has been $b$-tagged.
  
  In the \verb|Summer16+15| and \verb|Full16+15_HighMass|
  data-sets the same $b^*$ quark model is considered.
  Monte-Carlo simulation is used to produce a $b^*$ quark \mjj~signal template.
  Only leading order calculations are considered.
  %again \textsc{Pythia8}~\cite{dibjet-pythia8} with the A14~\cite{dibjet-a14} tune and the NNPDF23LO PDF set~\cite{dibjet-nnpdf} is used.
  Decays to $bg$, $b\gamma$, $bZ_0$ and $tW^{-}$ are considered.
  In the \verb|Full16+15_LowMass| data-set
  only the 2 $b$-tag category is used
  and as such that the $b^*$ quark model is not considered.
  %further details can be found in Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel-btag}.
  Simulated $b^*$ quark templates are produced at simulated mass points of
  1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000 and 5000~GeV.
\end{itemize}

\section{Event Selection}
\label{sec:evt-sel}

The overall aim when designing the di-$b$-jet analysis event selection
is two-fold.
Firstly, events are selected to
maximise sensitivity to signal;
which is approximated in terms of $S$/$\sqrt{B}$,
where $S$ is the number of benchmark signal events and $B$ is the number of background events.
Secondly, the smoothly falling nature of the background needs to be maintained
as this is the underlying assumption of the background estimation strategy,
which will be described in Chapter~\ref{sec:bkg}.
In addition, it is desirable that the event selection for the
\verb|Full16+15_HighMass| and \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set are
harmonised where possible such that the two analyses can be published together.
Any differences in event-selection between the two must be well motivated.

The di-$b$-jet event selection is split up into three sections each described separately.
Firstly, a pair of jets are selected (Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel-jets}),
then a set of event-level kinematic cuts are applied using the selected jets (Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel-event})
and finally $b$-tagging is applied to the jets (Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel-btag}).
In Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel-acc} the full event selection is summarised and
the signal acceptance is evaluated.

The event selection is slightly different for each of the data-sets considered,
these differences will be noted and discussed in the text.

\subsection{Jet Selection}
\label{sec:evt-sel-jets}

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_T$ algorithm with $R=0.4$
and calibrated using the EM+JES scheme;
a full description of jets used in this analysis is in Section~\ref{sec:obj-jets}.

At least two jets are required in an event.
The two highest \pT~jets, referred to as the leading and subleading jet,
are the jets used throughout this analysis.
To reduce the number of fake jets from sources such as calorimeter noise
both jets are required to pass \textit{loose} jet cleaning cuts
based on the properties and distributions of the energy deposits in the calorimeter associated to the jet;
details can be found in~\cite{evt-jet_cleaning}.

Cuts are applied to the leading and subleading jet-\pT~such that events are on the trigger plateau;
the kinematic region where all events passing the offline jet-\pT~selection
would also pass the online jet-\pT~requirements of the trigger
\footnote{Online refers to reconstructed objects used in the trigger decision
  whilst offline refers to objects reconstructed after events have passed the trigger at the data-processing level,
  from the definition in Section~\ref{sec:trig-bjet_eff}.}.
The jet-\pT~above which a single jet-trigger is on the trigger plateu is referred to as the threshold jet-\pT.

For the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set; it is required that the leading jet has \pT~$>$ 430 GeV to be on the trigger plateau of \verb|HLT_j380|.
This cut is derived by comparing the leading jet-\pT~distributions of jets that pass the trigger, \verb|HLT_j380|,
relative to a benchmark trigger with a lower jet-\pT~threshold, \verb|L1_J75|.
Figure~\ref{fig:evt-ICHEP_turnon}(a) shows this comparison in one run of data where \verb|L1_J75| was unprescaled
\footnote{Unprescaled means that the trigger accepts every event passing the trigger selection criteria};
in the ratio plot it is shown that for leading jet-\pT~$>$ 430 GeV events are on the trigger plateau.
The subleading jet is required to have jet-\pT~$>$ 60 GeV
to avoid contamination from pile-up jets
\footnote{Specifically, if jets have~\pT~$<$ 60 GeV then it is recommended that
  a pile-up suppression algorithm know as JVT is used~\cite{evt-jvt}.
  There is little gain in acceptance from the addition of low~\pT~subleading jets and
  complications from implementing the recommendations so the jets are removed. }.
Both jets  are required to have $|\eta| <$ 2.4
such that the jets lie within the volume of the ATLAS pixel detector,
which is essential for optimal $b$-tagging performance.

     \label{fig:evt-ICHEP_turnon}
\end{figure}

For the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| data-set the trigger \verb|HLT_j380| is also used,
and as such the leading jet is again required to have \pT~$>$ 430 GeV.
The subleading jet-\pT~is required to be $>$ 80 GeV to be consistent with the subleading jet-\pT~cut in the \verb|Full16_LowMass| event selection,
which will be described in the following paragraph.
Both jets  are required to have $|\eta| <$ 2.0;
the tighter cut on $|\eta|$ (relative to the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set) is selected
as at large values of jet-$|\eta|$ the $b$-Jet energy scale uncertainty is much larger.

For the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set a double $b$-jet trigger has been used;
which requires that there is an online jet with $p_T >$ 150 GeV and an online jet with $p_T >$ 50 GeV.
As before, to be on the trigger plateau, it is required that the leading and subleading offline jets
have a large enough jet-\pT~such that the corresponding online jets will pass the trigger-level~\pT~requirements.
To derive the~\pT~cuts one can consider the threshold jet~\pT~of the equivalent single jet triggers,
one that requires that there is an online jets with $p_T >$ 150 GeV and the other $p_T >$ 50 GeV.
To find the threshold jet-\pT~of the two single-jet triggers,
a linear fit to the threshold jet-\pT~of a range of single jet triggers is used,
details of the fit can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:triggerTurnOn_fit}.
Using the results of the fit the leading jet is required to have~\pT~$>$ 200 GeV
and the subleading jet is required to have~\pT~$>$ 80 GeV.
Both jets  are required to have $|\eta| <$ 2.0,
such that the $|\eta|$ cut is consistent for the \verb|Full16_LowMass| and \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| event selection.

\subsection{Event Level Cuts}
\label{sec:evt-sel-event}

Using the two selected jets; there are a set of event-level requirements.
Firstly, events are required to have good reconstruction quality;
specifically the primary vertex
must have at least two tracks associated with it
and events with problematic reconstruction in the Tile calorimeter, LAr calorimeter or SCT are rejected.
\textbf{LM Fix, not sure what these are}

\noindent
Secondly, there is a cut applied to the variable $y^*$, defined as
\begin{equation}
  y^* = \frac{(y_1-y_2)}{2}
\end{equation}
where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are the rapidities of the leading and subleading jet respectively.
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd-dijet_features}, QCD dijet production can occur through $t$-channel processes leading to more background events at large values of $|y^*|$,
whilst signal production occurs only through $s$-channel processes so will have no dependence on $y^*$.
Therefore, requiring $|y^*|$ below some threshold value will lead to an increased $S/\sqrt{B}$.

In the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set it is required that $|y^*| <$ 0.6.
This value has been shown to maximise $S/\sqrt{B}$ when no $b$-tagging is applied
at previous inclusive dijet searches at ATLAS~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper}
\footnote{Inclusive dijet analysis means a dijet analysis where no $b$-tagging is applied}.
The effect of $b$-tagging on the optimal value of this cut is assumed to be small,
as $t$-channel processes still dominate the background.

In the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| data-set it is required that $|y^*| <$ 0.8.
This value is derived by calculating $S/\sqrt{B}$ in the 2 $b$-tag category for a range of simulated mass points
using the SSM $Z'$-boson model as signal and the QCD background from simulation as background.
It has been found that $|y^*| <$ 0.8 maximises $S/\sqrt{B}$.

In the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set it is required that $|y^*| <$ 0.6.
The $|y^*|$ cut was not harmonised with the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| data-set
as it was shown that the looser cut introduced a kinematic bias at low values of~\mjj.
This will be demonstrated below.

Finally, the invariant mass of the two leading jets, \mjj, is required to be above a threshold value.
This cut ensures that there is no kinematic bias on the \mjj~distribution
from the trigger or jet-\pT~requirements described in Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel-jets}.
In addition, it is also required that the background is smooth in the \mjj~region chosen
such that it can be described using our background modelling strategy.

In the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set it is required that \mjj~\gt~1378 GeV;
which ensures the two conditions listed above are met.
Firstly, Figure~\ref{fig:evt-ICHEP_turnon}(b) shows the comparison of \mjj~distributions for events
that pass the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set event selection (exluding $b$-tagging), including the trigger \verb|HLT_j380|,
compared to events that pass a reference trigger, \verb|L1_J75|,
in one run of data where \verb|L1_J75| was unprescaled.
The ratio plot demonstrates that for \mjj~\gt~1100 GeV there is no kinematic bias from the trigger or event-selection.
%therefore we conclude that for \mjj~\gt~1378 GeV there is also no kinematic bias.
Secondly, it has been shown using simulated events that
\mjj~\gt~1378 GeV is required such that the \mjj~distribution from QCD dijet production
can be described by our background modelling strategy;
this study is presented in Section~\ref{sec:bkg-summer_range}.
Hence, \mjj~\gt~1378 GeV is the loosest cut that meets both of the conditions.

In the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| data-set it is required that \mjj~\gt~1200 GeV in the 2 $b$-tag category and
\mjj~\gt~1341 GeV in the $\geq1$ $b$-tag category;
which again ensures the two conditions required are met.
Firstly, Figure~\ref{fig:evt-hm_turnon} compares the dijet mass spectrum
for events that pass the trigger \verb|HLT_j380| and the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| jet-\pT~requirements
to events that pass a reference trigger, \verb|L1_J75|.
The comparsion is done in one run of data where \verb|L1_J75| was unprescaled.
For both spectra it is required that events pass the $|y^*|$ and jet-$|\eta|$ requirements of the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| event selection.
The ratio plot demonstrates that for \mjj~\gt~1200 GeV there is no kinematic bias from the trigger or event-selection.
Secondly, it will be shown in Section~\ref{sec:bkg-hm_spsig_1b}
that in the $\geq1$ $b$-tag category a cut of \mjj~\gt~1341 GeV is required such that the
\mjj~distribution from the background can be described by our background modelling strategy.
No such effect was observed in the 2 $b$-tag category.
Hence, \mjj~\gt~1200 GeV is required in the 2 $b$-tag category and
\mjj~\gt~1341 GeV is required in the 1 $b$-tag category.

     \label{fig:evt-hm_turnon}
\end{figure}

For the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set it is shown that for \mjj~\gt~500 GeV there is no kinematic bias
from the jet-\pT~cuts used in the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set event selection.
Figure~\ref{fig:evt-lowmass_turnon}(a) compares the~\mjj~distribution of events
that pass the event selection requirements that the leading (subleading) jet-\pT~$>$ 200 (80) GeV, labelled as `analysis~cuts',
compared to events that pass some arbitarily low cuts of leading (subleading) jet-\pT~$>$ 150 (50) GeV, labelled as `low~cuts'.
Events are required to pass the \verb|L1_J75| trigger and are taken from a run of 2016 data where \verb|L1_J75| was unprescaled.
The events are additionally required to pass the jet-$\eta$ and $|y^*|$ requirements of the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set event selection.
For \mjj~\gt~500 GeV there is no kinematic bias from the the \verb|Full16_LowMass| event selection,
this includes a one~\mjj~bin buffer that is used as a safety measure.
Figure~\ref{fig:evt-lowmass_turnon}(b) compares the~\mjj~distribution using the events that pass the analysis cuts and low cuts as before,
except that now a $|y^*| <$ 0.8 is applied.
For $|y^*| <$ 0.8 there is a kinematic bias in the~\mjj~range 500-544 GeV,
and as such the $|y^*| <$ 0.8 is not selected.

    No $b$-tagging cuts have been applied.}
     \label{fig:evt-lowmass_turnon}
\end{figure}

However, for the the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set
there is an additional kinematic bias on~\mjj~
due to the effect of jets other than the leading or subleading jet
that was discovered as the analysis progressed.
As a result the dijet mass is required to be greater than 566~GeV.
To describe the studies showing this effect I must first introduce
the $b$-tagging selections used in the \verb|Full16_LowMass| event-selection.
Therefore the studies into this effect are described below in Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel_btrigMatch}.

\subsection{$b$-Tagging}
\label{sec:evt-sel-btag}

The selection of $b$-jets, known as $b$-tagging,
forms an essential technique in the di-$b$-jet event selection.
A detailed description of $b$-tagging is found in Section~\ref{sec:obj-bjets}.
$b$-tagging is performed using a multi-variate algorithm known as MV2c10 which has been described in~\ref{sec:obj-bjets_MV2}.

Two $b$-tagging categories are used for the two different types of signal model considered.
The 2 $b$-tag category requires that both jets are $b$-tagged,
and is used to search for resonances decaying to 2 $b$-quarks such as the $Z'$ boson.
The $\geq 1$ $b$-tag category requires that at least one jet is tagged,
and is used to search for resonances decaying to 1 $b$-quark and a quark/gluon such as the $b^*$ quark.
The exclusive 1 $b$-tag category was also considered but was found to be less sensitive to the $b^*$ quark model.

In the \verb|Summer16+15| and \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| data-sets
$b$-tagging is performed using the 85\% operating point of the MV2c10 algorithm,
details on the operating points of MV2c10 are found in Section~\ref{sec:obj-bjets_MV2}.
This operating point was chosen to maximise $S/\sqrt{B}$ for a range of simulated mass points in the 2 $b$-tag category.

Below the details of the $b$-tagging optimisation study for the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| data-set are shown,
the results also validate the choice of $b$-tagging operating point in the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set.
The number of background events, $B$, is estimated in
a narrow~\mjj~window around
each simulated mass point considered using a
18.9~\ifb~subset of data for the 2 $b$-tag category.
The number of signal events, $S$, is estimated
in the same narrow~\mjj~windows using 
the simulated SSM $Z'$-boson signal template
described in Section~\ref{sec:evt-s+b} scaled to 18.9~\ifb~\footnote{This is
  the amount of data collected when the studies where performed}.
The full \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| event selection has been applied.
Table~\ref{tab:evt-btag_hm} summarises $S/\sqrt{B}$ for each operating point;
the 85\% operating point is selected as it performs well across the full range of mass points considered.
The conclusions of this study are luminosity independent
as $S/\sqrt{B} \propto \sqrt{L}$ such that the relative sensitivity
between operating points will be the same for all luminosities.

\label{tab:evt-btag_hm}
\end{center}
\end{table}

To further understand the effect of $b$-tagging in this analysis the flavour composition of the background is studied.
The dijet flavour composition is defined as the truth flavour of both of the jets used in the di-$b$-jet analysis,
using the definition of truth flavour from Section~\ref{sec:obj-bjets_label}.
Figure~\ref{fig:evt-summer_flavcomp} shows the dijet flavour composition of the simulated QCD dijet background in
the case where no $b$-tagging has been applied (inclusive) and in the $\geq1$ and 2 $b$-tag categories.
For this figure the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set event selection has been applied,
although the distributions are very similar for the \verb|Full16+15_HighMass| data-set
as the same $b$-tagging operating point has been chosen.

In the \verb|Full16+15_LowMass| data-sets $b$-tagging is performed using the 70\% operating point of the MV2c10 algorithm.
This operating point was chosen to maximise $S/\sqrt{B}$ for a range of simulated mass points.
It is expected that a tighter cut would optimal in the low mass data-set as a tight cut has already been applied at the trigger level.
\footnote{Section~\ref{sec:trig-bjet_eff} contains a description of the $b$-jet trigger sytematic uncertainties}

The details of the $b$-tagging optimisation study for the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set are as follows.
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:trig-bTrig_jetSys_opComp}
for the loose working point of 85\% the $b$-jet trigger systematics uncertainties
are significantly larger due to large purity uncertainties, and as a result the 85\% operating point is not considered.
The number of background events, $B$, is estimated in
a narrow~\mjj~window around each simulated mass point considered using a
3~\ifb~subset of \verb|Full16+15_LowMass| data.
The number of signal events, $S$, is estimated
in the same narrow~\mjj~windows using 
the simulated SSM $Z'$-boson signal template
described in Section~\ref{sec:evt-s+b} scaled to 3~\ifb~
\footnote{This is the amount of data available before unblinding when the studies where performed}.
The full \verb|Full16_LowMass| event selection has been applied.
Table~\ref{tab:evt-btag_lm} summarises $S/\sqrt{B}$ for each operating point;
the 70\% operating point is selected as it performs well across the full range of mass points considered
and as shown in Table~\ref{tab:trig-bTrig_jetSys_opComp} leads to a smaller jet-level $b$-jet trigger uncertainty.
Again the conclusions of this study are luminosity independent.

  \label{fig:evt-summer_flavcomp}
\end{figure}

There are a few features that can be noted in this figure.
Firstly, the flavour fraction of the background before $b$-tagging is dominated by light-jets
for the reasons outlined in~Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd-dijet_features}.
As the background is dominated by light-jets the application
of $b$-tagging can increase background rejection
and thus increase sensitivity to signal models that decay to $b$-quarks.
This motivates the use of $b$-tagging in the analysis.

Secondly, even after the application of $b$-tagging the largest contribution to the background is from light jets,
except for in a small region at low mass in the 2 $b$-tag category.
This shows that the sensitivity of the analysis is limited by the
light-jet rejection of $b$-tagging at high jet-\pT.

Finally, in all three cases the dijet flavour fractions are smooth, which is evidence that
there are no sudden changes in $b$-tagging efficiency of the background that could introduce
a non-smooth feature in the background invariant mass spectra.

\subsection{Effect of $b$-Jet Trigger Matching in the \textit{Full16\_LowMass} Data-set}
\label{sec:evt-sel_btrigMatch}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:trig-bjet},
the double $b$-jet trigger used in the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set
requires that there is one online jet with~\pT~\gt~150 GeV
and another online jet with~\pT~\gt~50 GeV.
Then both of these jets are required to be $b$-tagged at the online 60\% operating point.

As described in Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel-jets}, it is requried that the leading and subleading offline jet have a jet~\pT~above
the threshold jet-\pT~of the two trigger level requirements
\footnote{The offline jet-\pT~above which a single jet-trigger is on the trigger plateu is referred to as the threshold jet-\pT.}.
Then, in Section~\ref{sec:evt-sel-event} it was shown that in the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set
there is no kinematic bias in the dijet invariant mass distribution due to the leading and subleading offline jet~\pT~cuts.

However, it has been discovered that one must also consider the effect of offline jets other than the leading and subleading jet,
these jets I will refer to as `non-leading jets'.
It is possible that in an event that has passed the double $b$-jet trigger the
leading and subleading offline jet do not correspond to the
online jets that have been used in the double $b$-jet trigger.
Instead a non-leading offline jet could correspond one of the online jets used in the double $b$-jet trigger.
Therefore, it must be additionaly shown that in the dijet mass range considered there is not a kinematic bias
due to events where a non-leading jet is used by the the double $b$-jet trigger.

A study is performed to determine the effect of the $b$-jet trigger using non-leading jets on the dijet mass spectrum.
For this study offline jets are matched to online jets in a process known as trigger matching.
An offline jet is matched to an online jet if $\Delta R$
\footnote{Defined as $\Delta R = \sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2} + \Delta\phi^{2}}$. See Equation~\ref{eqn:det-deltaR} for more details.}
between the jets $<$ 0.4.
The matching is exclusive, which means that no online or offline jet can be involved in two matchings.
In the case that an offline jet can be matched to two online jets, then the pair of jets with the smallest~$\Delta R$ is chosen.
In the case where two offline jets can be matched to an online jet, the offline jet with the highest-\pT~is chosen;
this is done as there is a prior reason to believe that the leading and subleading jets are responsible
for passing the $b$-jet trigger requirements as they are known to pass offline $b$-tagging.
%To keep matching exclusive the following algorithm is performed.
%Firstly, the leading offline jet is matched to the online jet with the smallest $\Delta R$, if the value of $\Delta R <$ 0.4.
%This process is repeated with the subleading offline jet, excluding online jets that have already been matched.
%The other jets are the matched in a similar manner considered in order of jet-\pT.

Then one can define `$b$-jet trigger matched events' as events where
the leading and subleading offline jets have succesfully been matched to online jets
and that these online jets pass the double $b$-jet trigger level requirements described above.
In $b$-jet trigger matched events it is known that there is no effect from the non-leading jets.

To study $b$-jet trigger matched events an additional complication has to be overcome.
To perform trigger matching the \pT, $\eta$, $\phi$ and MV2c20 output of the online jets is required.
Data from the ATLAS collaboration is processed and stored in containers known as `derivation containers'
\footnote{Formally the `derivation containers' are known as Derived Analysis Object Data (DAODs)}
and the derivation containers are used by analyses at ATLAS.
To reduce the computer resources required to analyse each container, each derivation container contains only the events
and the reconstucted object information required to perform an analysis.
For the di-$b$-jet analysis a derivation called \textit{EXOT2} is used,
however the online jet information required is not present in the \textit{EXOT2} derivation containers.
Instead, a derivation container called \textit{FTAG1} is used, in which the trigger level information is present.
However, in the \textit{FTAG1} derivation not all events that pass the double $b$-jet trigger are included.
Therefore, in neither derivation container is the full information required to do $b$-jet trigger matching on the full \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set.

To overcome this problem the effect of $b$-jet trigger matching can be studied using the \textit{FTAG1} derivation.
Firstly, one can consider the dijet mass spectrum of all events in the \textit{FTAG1} derivation
that pass the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set event selection before $b$-jet trigger matching is applied.
I will refer to this as the dijet mass spectrum from \textit{FTAG1}.
Figure~\ref{fig:evt-btrig_match}(a) shows the dijet mass spectrum from \textit{FTAG1}
compared to the equivalent dijet mass spectrum using the \textit{EXOT2} derivation, where all events are present.
The full \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set event selection has been applied to both.
The lower panel shows a ratio between the two, this shows that there is a deficit of events
in the dijet mass spectrum from \textit{FTAG1}, particularly at low mass.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    For both plots the full \textit{Full16\_LowMass} event selection is applied }
     \label{fig:evt-btrig_match}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:evt-btrig_match}(b) shows the comparison of the dijet mass spectrum from \textit{FTAG1}
before and after the application of $b$-jet trigger matching.
The full \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set event selection has been applied in both cases.
A ratio of the two spectra is in the lower panel.
The ratio shows that $\sim$8\% of events that
pass the \verb|Full16_LowMass| event selection do not pass $b$-jet trigger matching requirement.
In these events it can be concluded that a non-leading jet is used in the double $b$-jet trigger.
For~\mjj~\gt~566 GeV the ratio is smooth with respect to dijet mass.
However in the region~\mjj~\lt~566 GeV there is a clear non-smoothness in the ratio plot,
which indicates that a kinematic bias could be present in the final data-set.

The background estimation strategy (described in Section~\ref{sec:bkg}) requires that the dijet mass spectrum must be smooth,
therefore it is required that there is no effect that can cause a non-smooth feature in the dijet mass spectrum.
It has been shown that for~\mjj~\gt 566 GeV there is no effect of non-leading jets in the double $b$-jet trigger
that can cause an un-smooth feature in the final data-set.
Therefore, for the \verb|Full16_LowMass| data-set it is required that~\mjj~\gt 566 GeV.

Finally it should be noted that for future iterations of the di-$b$-jet analysis
the full information required for $b$-jet trigger matching will be included in the \textit{EXOT2} dervation,
and as such trigger matching can be applied such that analyses can search a invariant mass range beginning at 500 GeV.

To better visualise events that pass the event selection,

        The left section of the figures show a cut-away of the ATLAS detector;
        the inner detector is shown in purple, the hadronic calorimeter is shown in blue
        and the toroid magnet and supporting structure is shown in black and grey.
        The upper right section of the figures show a close-up view of the inner tracker in the $r-z$ plane.
        In both sections tracks inside the inner detector are shown in orange
        and energy deposits in the EM and hadronic calorimeter are shown in cyan and yellow respectively.
        The two leading jets formed are indicated by the cones, where a blue cone indicates that the jet has been
        $b$-tagged and a yellow cone shows that it has not.
        The yellow spheres show the primary vertex candidates and the red spheres show the secondary vertex candidates.

With the event selection now defined,
the signal acceptance of the di-$b$-jet analysis is studied
to understand the performance of the analysis selection
and as an input to the limit-setting phase of the analysis.
The signal acceptance multiplied by trigger efficiency is defined as the 
the fraction of signal events that pass the analysis' trigger and event selection.
In addition, as $b$-tagging is a unique cut in our analysis relative to other dijet searches,
the event-tagging efficiency is also considered, which is defined as the fraction of events that pass
$b$-tagging cuts given that the event has passed all other aspects of the event selection.
Signal acceptance and event tagging efficiency are estimated using the
Monte-Carlo signal templates discussed in Section~\ref{sec:evt-s+b}.

For the \verb|Summer16+15| data-set event-selection;
Figure~\ref{fig:evt-ichep_acc}(a) shows the signal acceptance multiplied by trigger efficiency
for the $b^*$ and $Z'$ signal models
as a function of the simulated mass
in the case that $b$-tagging is applied and when it is not applied.
Figure~\ref{fig:evt-ichep_acc}(b) shows the event tagging efficiency
for the $b^*$ and $Z'$ for a range of simulated mass points
as a function of the reconstructed invariant mass,~\mjj.
In both plots the $b$-tagging category used is labelled in the legend.

There are a few features of the signal acceptance and tagging efficiency that can be commented on.
There is a reduced signal acceptance at lower values of simulated mass
because there is a low mass tail of the signal template which lies below the~\mjj~cut,
the tail is caused by a preference for low values of~\mjj~by the PDFs.
In addition, the event tagging efficiency decreases at high values of~\mjj~
due to a lower performance of $b$-tagging at high jet-\pT.
\textbf{LM Fix: Refer to high-pT~$b$-tagging, will be added to b-tag chapter}.
Finally, the $b^*$ quark has a similar tagging efficiency
as the $Z'$-boson in the $\geq$1 $b$-tag category at high~\mjj;
whilst naively one would expect that the $Z'$-boson should have a higher
event tagging efficiency as it decays to two $b$-quarks,
the gluon from the $b^*$ quark decay can split into a pair of lower~\pT~$b$-quarks
which can often be tagged leading to a similar tagging efficiency.

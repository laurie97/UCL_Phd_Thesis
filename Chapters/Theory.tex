\chapter{An Incomplete Theory}
\label{sec:theo}

One of the great questions that humans have always tried to answer is
what are the fundamental building blocks of the universe and what are the rules that govern them?
Attempts at answering this question have ranged from the
philosophical approach of \textit{`atomism'} by the ancient Greeks \cite{theo-atomism}
to the discovery of atomic structure by Ernest Rutherford \cite{theo-rutherford}.

The current best answer to this question is the \textit{`Standard Model of Particle Physics'},
a mathematical description of a finite set of fundamental particles and their interactions.
The Standard Model's ability to describe data is formidable
and as such it is the foundation of the field of Particle Physics. 
However, it is known that this is not a complete theory and there must be
a deeper underlying theory that lies beyond the Standard Model.

This chapter firstly aims to describe the Standard Model and its key predictions
with respect to the analyses presented in this thesis.
Section~\ref{sec:theo-sm} briefly describes the Standard Model and
Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd} outlines the QCD description of jet formation and dijet production in proton-proton collisions.
Then, Section~\ref{sec:theo-bsm} will discuss Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics;
specifically the problems in the Standard Model that require BSM physics
and proposed BSM models that predict resonances preferentially decaying to one or two $b$-quarks.

\section{The Standard Model}
\label{sec:theo-sm}

The Standard Model is a quantum field theory,
meaning that the theory describes a finite set of particles and their interactions in
terms of a set of fields.
The end product of the Standard Model is a prediction
of what will happen when any two particles in nature interact;
which in the context of a collider experiment means predicting what is the cross-section of any given interaction.

Section~\ref{sec:theo-sm_particles} contains a description of the particles that make up the Standard Model 
and Section~\ref{sec:theo-sm_forces} contains a description of the types of interactions between the particles, known as forces.

\subsection{Particles}
\label{sec:theo-sm_particles}

There are 18 fundamental particles in the Standard Model,
where fundamental means that they are not composed of other constituent particles.
These particles are grouped into three families with similar properties;
known as quarks, leptons and bosons.
Details on the particles in the Standard Model is taken from~\cite{obj-bjets_PDG}, where a full description can be found.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item\textbf{Quarks:}
  Quarks are fermions that interact with the strong force;
  a description of the strong force is in the next section.
  There are 6 different types of quarks, known as flavours, arranged in 3 generations.
  Table~\ref{tab:theo-sm_quarks} summarises the flavours of quark and their key properties.
  For each quark there is also an anti-quark, which has identical mass and spin, but opposite charge and quantum numbers.

\item\textbf{Leptons:}
  Leptons are fermions that, unlike the quarks, do not interact with the strong force.
  There are 6 different types of leptons,
  arranged into  3 generations, each containing a charge $-1$ particle and a charge 0 neutrino.
  Table~\ref{tab:theo-sm_leptons} summarises the leptons and their key properties.
  Neutrinos masses are not well known, but they are known to be non-zero
  and the sum of the masses of the three flavours of neutrino is less than a few eV~\cite{theo-nu_mass},
  hence are negligible compared to the other particles of the Standard Model.
  %\footnote{The upper constraint on neutrino mass means that neutrinos are much lighter than the other particles
  %in the Standard Model and the energy scale considered in this thesis; so they will be treated as massless here.}
  For each lepton there is also an anti-lepton.

\subsection{Forces}
\label{sec:theo-sm_forces}

The Standard Model combines three key theories in a
$SU(3)~\text{x}~SU(2)~\text{x}~U(1)$ gauge symmetry.
The first key theory is the electro-weak theory~\cite{theo-glashow};
this theory is based on mixing within the symmetry group $SU(2)~\text{x}~U(1)$
leading to three distinct interaction types grouped into two forces:
the electro-magnetic and weak forces.
The second is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)~\cite{theo-qcd} which describes the strong force.
Finally, the Brout-Englert-Higgs Mechanism~\cite{theo-be,theo-higgs} describes the origin of mass in the Standard Model.

\noindent
The properties of each force are discussed below:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item\textbf{Electro-magnetic (EM):}

  The EM force is an interaction between charged particles and is mediated by the photon.
  The strength of a force is often given in terms of the coupling constant, $\alpha$.
  In this case the EM coupling is proportional to the EM coupling constant, $\alpha_{EM}$,
  multiplied by the product of the charges of the two particles, where $\alpha_{EM} \sim$ 1/137.\\ %\vspace{0.5em}

\item\textbf{Weak Force:}
  
  The weak force is composed of the two remaining interactions from electro-weak theory;
  the neutral current interaction and the charged current interaction.
  
  The neutral current interaction is mediated by the $Z_0$ boson, has a universal interaction to all fermions,
  and does not allow flavour changing interactions.

  The charged current interaction is mediated by the $W^+$ and $W^-$ boson, has a universal interaction with all fermions,
  and flavour changing interactions are allowed.
  In the quark sector, the charged current interaction
  couples with weak eigenstates of fermions rather than their flavour eigenstates,
  allowing for interactions that change the generation of the quark's flavour.
  The relative amplitudes of each flavour changing interaction is described by the CKM matrix;
  the values of this matrix highly suppresses generational changing interactions involving the 3rd generation of quarks.
  %This high supprestion will prove important for identifying the presence of $b$-quarks at the ATLAS detector, which will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:obj-bjets}.
  Both interactions of the weak force are much weaker than the EM force
  due to the large masses of the mediating particles
  ($\text{Weak}/\text{EM} \sim 10^{-4}$).\\ %\vspace{0.5em}
  
\item\textbf{Strong Force:}

  Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a theory based on a $SU(3)$ gauge symmetry that describes the strong force.
  The strong force is mediated by the gluon and interacts with particles that have colour charge; which are quarks and gluons.
  The fact that the gluon has colour charge means that the gluon is self interacting.
  The $SU(3)$ symmetry results in 3 colour charges: known as red, green and blue.
  An anti-quark has colour charge anti-red, anti-blue or anti-green.
  A colour neutral object can be formed if all three colour charges are present (i.e. in a baryon containing three quarks)
  or if a colour and the corresponding anti-colour is present (i.e. in a meson that contains $q\bar{q}$).
  QCD is important in terms of understanding hadronic jet formation and the production of the
  largest background in a di-$b$-jet search, so further details can be found in section in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd}.\\

\item\textbf{Higgs Mechanism:}
  The Higgs Mechanism \footnote{Also known as the Higgs-Englert-Brout mechanism}
  introduces an extra scalar field to the Standard Model
  with a Higgs potential given by the so-called `Mexican-hat potential'.
  This allows for spontaneous symmetry breaking which gives mass to the bosons of the Standard Model.
  In addition, a Yukawa coupling term between the scalar field and the fermions gives rise to the mass of the fermions
  \footnote{With the exception of the neutrinos, whose mass is not described by the Standard Model}.
  A final prediction of the Higgs mechanism is the existence of a spin-0 boson, known as the Higgs boson.
  The first observation of a Higgs boson like object by the ATLAS~\cite{theo-higgs_atlas} and CMS~\cite{theo-higgs_cms} experiments
  in 2012 appears to confirm the Higgs mechanism, which is seen as a great triumph of the Standard Model.
\end{itemize}

\section{QCD: Hadronic Jet Formation and Dijet Production}
\label{sec:theo-qcd}

As described above Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a theory that describes the strong interaction between
quarks and gluons.
QCD therefore describes two elements that are critical to the analysis being presented in this thesis;
specifically the formation of hadronic jets and the production of dijet events through QCD in proton-proton collisions,
which will be the dominant background in the analysis presented in this thesis.

This section will firstly describe renormalisation of QCD, which is important for understanding how QCD works,
and will then describe the process of hadronic jet formation and dijet production in hadron collisions.
Quarks and gluons can often fill similar roles in hadronic jet formation and dijet production, hence I will refer to them collectively as `partons' in this section.

\subsection{Renormalisation and the Running of $\alpha_S$}
\label{sec:theo-qcd_dijet_running}

For any calculation in QCD, or indeed any quantum field theory, one must consider the higher order loop diagrams;
for example for a simple gluon propagator there are additional first-order loops as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:theo-qcd_gluon}.
The summation over all higher-order loops lead to divergences in calculations of scattering events in QCD.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth, angle=0]{figs/Theory/qcd_gluon_loop.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption[A schematic showing the gluon propagator with the additional first order loops.]
  {A schematic showing the gluon propagator with the additional first order loops~\cite{det-thesis_kate}.}
  \label{fig:theo-qcd_gluon}
\end{figure}

To avoid these divergences, there is a well accepted mathematical tool known as renormalisation,
where one effectively re-scales the fields in the Lagrangian.
Renormalisation is done is done such that the divergences are removed
and one can perform calculations of QCD in a perturbative expansion.
This leads to a dependence of the strong coupling, $\alpha_S$, on the renormalisation scaled used, $\mu_R$,
an effect known as the running of $\alpha_S$.
To get a an effective strength of the strong interaction in any given process,
once sets the value of $\mu_R$ to be the scale of the momentum transfer $Q$ of the process.
%%which is the natural choice for the process.
%$\alpha_S($\mu_R \sim Q^{2}$).
The running of $\alpha_S$ can be measured through experimental observation;
Figure~\ref{fig:theo-qcd_running} shows the measured values of
the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_S$ as a function of the energy scale, $Q$, in a range of experiments.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth, angle=0]{figs/Theory/qcd_running.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption[Summary of measurements of $\alpha_S$ as a function of the energy scale $Q$.
    The respective degree of QCD perturbation theory used in the extraction of $\alpha_S$ is indicated in brackets
    (NLO: next-to-leading order; NNLO: next-to-next-to leading order; res. NNLO: NNLO matched with resummed next-to-leading logs; N3LO: next-to-NNLO).]
          {Summary of measurements of $\alpha_S$ as a function of the energy scale $Q$.

  \label{fig:theo-qcd_running}
\end{figure}

There are three features of Figure~\ref{fig:theo-qcd_running} that can be noted.
Firstly, the size of the coupling constant, $\alpha_S$, is generally large compared to $\alpha_{EM}$;
this means that, depending on the energy scale $Q$, the strong force is typically stronger than the $EM$ force by one or two orders of magnitude.
Secondly, at high-energies/low-distance scales the strong force becomes relatively weak, this phenomenon is known as
\textit{`asymptotic freedom'}.
At these energy scales, perturbative expansions of QCD are possible.
Finally, at low-energies/large-distance scales the strong force is exceptionally strong.
As a result, if two interacting quarks become separated by a large distance then it becomes energetically favourable to
pair-produce $q\bar{q}$ pairs from the vacuum until a colour neutral object can be formed.
Therefore quarks are not observed in isolation but instead quarks form colour neutral hadrons, this feature of QCD is known as \textit{`confinement'}.

\subsection{Hadronic Jet Formation}
\label{sec:theo-qcd_jets}

It is common in hadronic colliders that a high-momentum quark or gluon will be produced in the final-state
\footnote{an example of this is dijet production, as will be described in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd_dijet}.}.
However, as described in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd_dijet_running},
the large values of $\alpha_S$ at large distance-scales require quark confinement, meaning that an isolated quark or gluon will not be observed.
Instead a stream of energetic, collimated hadrons will be formed, known as a hadronic jet.
Hadronic jet formation occurs through two distinct processes; parton-shower and hadronisation.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  
\item\textbf{Parton Shower:}

  The high-energy final-state quark or gluon has a finite probability of splitting into a quark-gluon or quark-quark pair respectively.
  The resulting quarks and gluons will also undergo splitting to form more partons,
  which in turn can split. This process continues to form the parton shower.
  Due to relativistic effects, each splitting will generally be at a small opening angle in the lab-frame
  and as such the partons will be highly collimated in the direction of the initial parton.
  The parton shower process occurs at high energy such that the value of $\alpha_S$ is small
  and thus perturbative expansions of QCD can be used to perform calculations.
  However, at each step of the splitting the energy of the partons decreases
  and thus the value of $\alpha_S$ increases.\\
  
\item\textbf{Hadronisation:}
  
  When the energy scale becomes small
  \footnote{This is generally defined as small relative to the hadronic scale, $\Lambda$, which is typically a few hundred MeV},
  $\alpha_S$ becomes large such that the dominant QCD effect is quark confinement.
  Therefore, $q\bar{q}$ pairs are produced until the quarks resulting from the parton shower can form hadrons.
  The hadrons are colour neutral objects, meaning that stable hadrons that do not interact through QCD will be formed
  \footnote{Some unstable hadrons, such as a $\Delta^{++}$, may be initially formed in the process but these will decay rapidly through the strong interaction.
    In addition, some hadrons might not be stable under the weak interaction, such as a Kaon, but the time-scale of their decays will be much larger.}.
  The hadronisation process occurs at large values of $\alpha_S$ so cannot be calculated using perturbative expansions;
  models such as the string model~\cite{theo-qcd_jet_string} and the
  cluster model~\cite{theo-qcd_jet_cluster} are used to simulate hadronisation.

\end{itemize}
  
The end result of the hadronisation process is a set of collimated stable hadrons,
known as a hadronic jet, which can be observed in an experiment.
Note that our understanding of how one goes from an initial parton to a hadronic jet is model dependant,
for example there is a choice of hadronisation model.
Hence, in experiment we remove this dependence by defining a jet in terms of observables,
such that the experimental results are model-independent and results can be reinterpreted when improved models become available
\footnote{A good explanation of why model-independent jets is desirable is found here~\cite{theo-jets_jb}}.
The details of the experimental definition of a hadronic jet is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:obj-jets}.

\subsection{Dijet Production in $pp$ Collisions}
\label{sec:theo-qcd_dijet}


Dijet production is one of the most common process that occurs in any hadron collider.
The first step of dijet production in $pp$ colliders is the two protons interacting through QCD to give two quarks or gluons in the final state;
the frequency of this interaction is described by the hadronic cross-section, $\sigma_{had}$.
The free partons will then form hadronic jets through the processes described in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd_jets}, which can be observed.
As an example, Figure~\ref{fig:theo-qcd_dijet_feynman} shows the Feynman diagram of
dijet production in a proton-proton collision through the $qg \to qg$ channel.

  \label{fig:theo-qcd_dijet_feynman}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Factorisation}

To calculate the hadronic cross-section, $\sigma_{had}$, in a proton-proton collision,
two elements are separated out in a process called factorisation.

The first element is the parton-level cross-section, $\hat{\sigma}$, which is the cross-section of
two partons from the proton ($p_i$ and $p_j$) scattering to give two final state partons ($p_k$ and $p_l$).
This is effectively the central part of the Feynman diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:theo-qcd_dijet_feynman}.

The second element is the Parton Density Functions (PDFs), $f_i(x_i)$, which give the number density of
a specific parton, $p_i$, with momentum fraction, $x_i$, in a proton.
Momentum fraction is defined as the fraction of the proton's total momentum that the parton is carrying, $x = p_{\text{parton}}/p_{\text{proton}}$.
The number density affects the overall cross-section, as it changes the probability that a specific parton
can form the initial parton propagators.
This part of the interaction is indicated by the circles in the
top and bottom left of the Feynman diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:theo-qcd_dijet_feynman}.

The elements are combined to calculate the total $\sigma_{had}$;
\begin{equation}
%  \sigma(p_1p_2\to q/g_k q/g_l) = \int dx_1 dx_2 f_1(x_1,\mu^2_F)f_2(x_2\mu^2_F) \sigma(q/g_1,q/g_2, \alpha_s(\mu^2_R),Q^2/\mu^2_F,Q^2/\mu^2_R)
  \sigma_{had} = \sum_{i,j,k,l} \int dx_i\hspace{0.3mm} dx_j \hspace{1mm} f_i(x_i,Q^2)\hspace{1mm}f_j(x_j,Q^2)\hspace{1mm}\hat{\sigma}(p_i, p_j\to p_k p_l)
\end{equation}
where there is an integral over all possible values of momentum fractions $x_i$ and $x_j$,
a sum over all possible partons from the two protons labelled $i$ and $j$,
and a sum over all possible final-state partons labelled by $k$ and $l$
\footnote{The final state sums do not include top-quarks because, as will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:theo-ttbar}, they do not form regular jets. 
  In addition, due to its heavy mass, the top-quark is heavily supressed in the PDFs so can be ignored in the sum over initial partons.}.
$Q^2$ is the energy scale of the collision.

\noindent
With the two elements separated we can discuss each separately.

\subsubsection{Parton-level Cross-Section}
\label{sec:theo-qcd_dijet_xs}

To describe the parton-level cross-section we must first define a few variables.
The first is the invariant mass of the outgoing partons, $m_{kl}$, which is given in terms of the four-momentum of the two partons;
\begin{equation}
  m_{kl}^2 = (p^\mu_k + p^\mu_l)^2  
\end{equation}
\noindent
Then there are two related angular variables, $y^*$ and $\theta^*$,
defined in terms of the rapidities of the outgoing partons, $y_k$ and $y_l$;
\begin{equation}
  y^* = (\frac{y_k - y_l}{2}),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  cos(\theta^*) = \tanh(y^*)
\end{equation}
\noindent
Finally the Mandelstam variables, generally used to describe a 2$\to$2 particle scatter event, are defined as 
\begin{equation}
  \hat{s} = m_{kl}^2, \hspace{3mm}  \hat{t} = -\hat{s}\hspace{1mm}(1 - \cos{\theta^*}), \hspace{3mm} \hat{u} = - \hat{s}\hspace{1mm}(1+\cos{\theta^*})
\end{equation}

\noindent
The parton-level cross-section of incoming partons $i$ and $j$ scattering to give
outgoing partons $k$ and $l$ is given in terms of the variables $\theta^*$ and $m_{kl}$~\cite{theo-dijet_harris};
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\hat{\sigma}(p_i, p_j \to p_k p_l)}{dm_{kl}\hspace{1mm}d\cos{\theta^*}} = \frac{ \pi \alpha_s}{m_{kl}}\hspace{1mm} \text{S}(ab \to ij) \hspace{1mm} \frac{1}{1+\delta_{kl}}
  \label{eq:theo-qcd_dijet_xs}
\end{equation}
Where $\text{S}(ab \to ij)$ gives the process dependant kinematics of a $ab \to ij$  parton scatter.
$\text{S}(ab \to ij)$ for each process is given in Table~\ref{tab:theo-qcd_dijet_s}.

\subsubsection{Parton Density Functions}
\label{sec:theo-qcd_pdf}

A naive model of the proton contains two up-quarks and a down-quark,
known as valence quarks, each carrying $\frac{1}{3}$ of the proton's momentum.
However, QCD interactions within the proton mean that gluons can be emitted from the valence quarks
and $q\bar{q}$ pairs can be produced from the emitted gluons.
This means that, in reality, the proton is made up of the three valence quarks, typically carrying a large fraction of the proton's momentum,
in addition to a sea of quarks and gluons from QCD effects, that will typically carry a lower fraction of the proton's momentum.

Parton Density Functions (PDFs) give the number density of a specific parton $p_i$ in a proton $P_i$
for a given momentum fraction $x_i$ and energy scale, $Q$.
Due to the large value of $\alpha_S$ in the proton, QCD cannot be considered in pertubative expansions and as such the PDFs cannot be calculated directly.
Instead the PDFs can be measured by combining a range of experimental scattering results.
In particular, strong constraints on the PDFs come from deep inelastic scattering using $ep$ colliders, such as HERA~\cite{theo-qcd_hera};
the strong constraints are due, in part, to there only being one parton in the collision allowing direct access to the PDFs in a cross-section measurement.

%%%%%%%%%  Note Laurie %%%%%%%%%
%%%% In general one would do e- + p -> e- + jet at HERA
%%%% For sensitiviy to certain versions would could vary the analysis
%%%% For example  e- + s -> mu_e + c->D meson -> mu_e + (jet with muon).

Figure~\ref{fig:theo-qcd_pdf} shows the $x\hspace{0.3mm}F(x,Q^2)$ for a $Q^2$ of 10 and $10^4$ $\text{GeV}^2$
from the MMHT2014 PDF set~\cite{theo-qcd_pdf}.
The various coloured lines represent the PDF for each of the different partons.

\begin{table}[!hbt]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth, angle=0]{figs/Theory/qcd_pdf.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption[MMHT2014 NNLO PDFs at $Q^2$ = 10 $\text{GeV}^2$ and $Q^2$ = $10^4$ $\text{GeV}^2$, with associated 68\% confidence-level uncertainty bands.]
  {MMHT2014 NNLO PDFs at $Q^2$ = 10 $\text{GeV}^2$ and $Q^2$ = $10^4$ $\text{GeV}^2$, with associated 68\% confidence-level uncertainty bands~\cite{theo-qcd_pdf}.}
  \label{fig:theo-qcd_pdf}
\end{table}

One can note that as $x$ increases the values of the PDF for the sea quarks and gluons will fall smoothly;
this is because it is energetically unfavourable to emit a high momentum gluon or $q\bar{q}$ pair.
The fall in the PDFs with respect to $x$ is particularly notable for the gluon which is the dominant contribution at large values of $Q^2$.

The PDFs of the valence quarks, $u_v$ and $d_v$, have a peak value around $x \sim \frac{1}{3}$, and then fall off rapidly at higher $x$.
If one considered the proton in the initial naive model of the proton then we find the PDFs of valence quarks as delta peaks at exactly $\frac{1}{3}$
with amplitude of $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ for the $u$ and $d$ quark respectively;
however, QCD interactions have smeared this peak to what is observed.

\subsubsection{Features of the Hadronic Cross-section}

There are four important features that one can qualitatively describe about the dijet hadronic cross-section
from the two factorised elements shown in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd_dijet_xs}~and~\ref{sec:theo-qcd_pdf}.
These important features will have significance when forming the di-$b$-jet search analysis strategy in
Chapters~\ref{bkg}\textit{Background estimation chapter} and~\ref{evt}\textit{Event selection chapter}.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item\textbf{Large cross-section :}\\
  The strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ is much larger than the other forces,
  meaning that the dijet cross-section is large.
  As a result dijet production through QCD is one of the most common events at hadron colliders
  and will be the strongly dominant background in any di-$b$-jet search.\vspace{0.5em}
  
\item\textbf{Behaviour with respect to $m_{kl}$ :}\\
  It can be seen that the hadronic cross-section causes
  a smooth and monotonically decreasing spectrum
  with respect to $m_{kl}$ as a result of three factors.
  Firstly, the cross section has a $1/m_{kl}$ term.
  Secondly, as shown in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd_dijet_running},
  $\alpha_S$ will smoothly decrease with increasing $Q$, which in this case is linked to $m_{kl}$.
  Finally, as $m_{kl}$ increases then the momentum fraction of the proton, $x$, required to create
  the dijet event will also increase.
  As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:theo-qcd_pdf}, the parton density functions are generally falling 
  with respect to $x$, which will lead to falling behaviour in the hadronic cross-section.
  \vspace{0.5em}
  
\item\textbf{Behaviour with respect to $y^*$ :}\\
  In all but one of the $\text{S}(ab \to ij)$ terms shown in Table~\ref{tab:theo-qcd_dijet_s},
  we see that there is a $1/\hat{t}$ term, which originates from the t-channel Feynman diagram.
  This term will become large when $\cos{\theta^*} \to 1$
  causing the dijet cross-section to peak at large values of $\cos{\theta^*}$ and $y^*$.
  \vspace{0.5em}

\item\textbf{Flavour Preference:}\\
  Table~\ref{tab:theo-qcd_dijet_s} shows that all the processes that produce heavy flavour quarks ($c$ or $b$),
  with the exception of $q_1 \bar{q_1} \to q_2 \bar{q_2}$ and $g g \to q \bar{q}$,
  require a heavy flavour quark to be one of the initial partons.
  However, Figure~\ref{fig:theo-qcd_pdf} shows the heavy flavour quarks are suppressed in
  the PDFs relative to the other partons.
  Therefore, dijet events will be dominated by jets initiated by gluons or light-quarks ($u$, $d$ or $s$).
  
  
\end{itemize}

Finally, it should be noted that the above description of the dijet cross-section is
not a full description; I have only considered the tree-level diagrams, 
but one needs to consider higher orders of QCD to give a complete description of dijet production.
Related to that issue is the occurrence of initial state and final state radiation, known as ISR and FSR respectively.
ISR is when an additional parton is radiated off the incoming parton and FSR is when an additional parton is radiated off the outgoing parton to form a separate jet.
This can lead to additional jets in an event, creating a multi-jet event.

In addition, there is also the Underlying Event (UE) which effectively comprises of the remnants of the proton not used in the hard-scatter.
The UE will mostly be hadronic activity and as a result can lead to additional jets in the event, again creating a multi-jet event.

\subsection{A Special Case: $t\bar{t}$}
\label{sec:theo-ttbar}

The top-quark is a special case when discussing the formation of jets from quarks,
due to two properties of the top quark which are distinctive.
Firstly, due to the large suppression of decays from the 3rd generation in the CKM matrix,
the top quark decays to a $b$-quark and a $W$-boson with a branching ratio of close to~1.
Secondly, the top quark is much heavier than the bottom quark
meaning that the decay to a $b$-quark is very energetically favourable,
such that top-quark decays a shorter time-scale than parton shower process.
Therefore, the top-quark results in two separate objects; the $W$-boson and the hadronic jet.
\footnote{If the top-quark has a large-$p_T$ then the resulting $W$-boson and jet can merge.}.

As in dijet production, $t\bar{t}$ pairs can be pair-produced in proton-proton collisions through QCD interactions.
The two top quarks will decay into two $W$-bosons and two jets containing $b$-quarks.
One mode of $t\bar{t}$ decay is when one $W$-boson decays into a $l^+~\nu_l$ pair and the other into a $l^{-}~\bar{\nu_l}$ pair.
This is known as a di-lepton $t\bar{t}$ event, a Feynman diagram showing an example of a di-lepton $t\bar{t}$ event is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:theo-ttbar}\footnote{This figure shows the $q\bar{q}$ mode of $t\bar{t}$ production. It should be noted that the $gg$ mode is the dominant at the LHC}.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth, angle=0]{figs/Theory/ttbar.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption[A Feynman diagram showing an example of a di-lepton $t\bar{t}$ event.]
  {A Feynman diagram showing an example of a di-lepton $t\bar{t}$ event~\cite{theo-ttbar_feyn}.}
  \label{fig:theo-ttbar}
\end{figure}

Di-lepton $t\bar{t}$ forms a distinct experimental signature.
In particular, the case of opposite flavour di-lepton $t\bar{t}$, where the two leptons have different flavours, is very distinct
because this has been caused by two separate weak-decays which would typically be suppressed,
but here the large mass of the top overcomes this suppression.
In addition we have two jets formed from $b$-quarks, which can be observed.
The distinct signature of di-lepton $t\bar{t}$ events and the fact that they always contain $b$-jets
means that this decay topology is often used to obtain a pure sample of $b$-jets,
such as in Section~\ref{sec:obj-bjets_calib}~and~\ref{sec:trig-bjet_eff}.

\section{Beyond the Standard Model}
\label{sec:theo-bsm}

The preceding sections of this chapter described the Standard Model
and some of its successes,
such as the prediction of the Higgs boson and the ability to describe complex phenomena such as di-jet production.

However, the Standard Model is known to be an incomplete picture of the universe;
in this section I will discuss some of the key deficiencies of the Standard Model demonstrating
that Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics is required.
I will then discuss some proposed BSM models that motivate the analyses shown in this thesis.

\subsection{Motivations for Beyond the Standard Model}

The motivations for BSM physics listed in this section
describe only a subset of deficiencies of the Standard Model,
with a focus on the most important missing parts and
those that motivate models searched for in this thesis.

\subsubsection{Gravity}

When listing forces in Section~\ref{sec:theo-sm_forces}, we made no reference to gravity.
This is because our description of gravity, Einstein's General Theory of Relativity,
has not been successfully merged with Quantum Physics in a so-called `Quantum Theory of Gravity'.
It is a clear inadequacy of the Standard Model that there is no explanation of gravity
%partly due to the fact that gravity is hard to study at the quantum-level because
%it is so much weaker than the other forces
%(of order $10^{-39}$ compared to the strong interaction) .
% \textbf{LM Fix: Reference?}.
%There have been theoretical attempts to decribe gravity such that it is comptible with the Standard Model,
%such as the Randall-Sundrum Graviton~\cite{theo-bsm_randall},
%but so far these have not been substantiated by experimental evidence.%~\cite{trig-H4b}.

\subsubsection{Dark Matter}
\label{sec:theo_bsm_dm}

%It is remarkable that the physics that describes the largest and smallest scale known,
%Astronomy and Particle Physics,
%are often deeply related; the prediction of Dark Matter (DM) is a great example of this.

%Astronomers are able to make observations of distant galaxies using
%EM-waves, that allows observation of Standard Model particles  
%and are have been succesful in explaining the observed galaxies in terms of the particles of the Standard Model,
%listed in Section~\ref{sec:theo-sm_particles}.
%However, due to the large masses of astronomical objects,
%astronomers also have access to observing the action of gravity.

Astronomers are able to make observations of distant galaxies and stars
to study their dynamics in terms of both Standard Model processes
and, due to the large masses of galaxies, gravitational interactions.
This has meant that astrophysicists have made a remarkable observation that
80\% of the universe's matter must be so-called `Dark Matter'~\cite{theo-bsm_dm_peskin}.
Dark Matter are particles not described by the Standard Model,
so is clear evidence of Beyond Standard Model physics.
It is known that Dark Matter must interact weakly with the Standard Model,
otherwise we would have already observed it through interactions with Standard Model particles,
and that Dark Matter must be massive, otherwise it would not interact through gravity.

The evidence for Dark Matter comes from many separate astronomical observations:
such as studies of
galaxy rotation curves,
colliding galaxies known as bullet clusters,
and the cosmic microwave background.
%and galaxies using gravitataional lensing.
A wider summary of the evidence for Dark Matter can be found here~\cite{theo-bsm_dm_evidence}.

%\begin{figure}[!b]

%  \label{fig:theo-bsm_dm_gl}
%\end{figure}
%
%The cited summary provides a more rigorous explanation of the evidence than can be provided here.
%But I would like to discuss one particular bit of evidence,
%specifically measurements of bullet clusters using X-ray telescopes and gravitational lensing~\cite{theo-bsm_dm_gl}.
%Gravitational lensing occurs when the path of light from some distant astronomical source is bent by the gravitational effect of a nearer galaxy.
%Figure~\ref{fig:theo-bsm_dm_gl}(a) shows an image of a bullet cluster and the surrounding galaxies in the visible part of the light spectrum using the Hubble telescope.
%Using the gravitational lensing effect in this image one can infer the mass density profile of the bullet cluster, which is shown by the green contour lines.
%One can also observe the galaxy using an X-ray telescope,
%allowing an observation of the number density profile of Standard Model particles in a galaxy which, when hot, will emit X-ray radiation.
%Figure~\ref{fig:theo-bsm_dm_gl}(b) shows an image of the same bullet cluster in the X-ray part of the light spectrum using the Chandra telescope;
%the mass density profile estimated using the visible spectrum has again been overlaid.
%One can see that the mass density profile of the bullet cluster is inconsistent with the
%number density profile of the Standard Model particles from the X-ray telescope.
%Hence one can conclude that there must be additional Dark Matter particles in this bullet cluster
%causing the shift in the mass density profile.

Furthermore it is believed that the Dark Matter couples to the Standard Model;
the evidence for such a statement stems from the observed relative abundance of Dark Matter particles in the universe.
The most common method of explaining the abundance
%, known as 'freeze-out',
argues that in the early and hot universe Dark Matter and Standard Model particles
freely interact such that they were in thermal equilibrium.
As the universe expands and cools this interaction is suppressed
and the number density of Dark Matter is fixed at the value we observe today~\cite{theo-bsm_dm_feng}.
%The most common method of explaining the abundance is by postulating that
%DM and SM particles were produced in the same abundance in the Big Bang,
%and in the early hot and dense universe they could interact freely such that they are in thermal equilibrium.
%As the universe begins to cool and expand this number density will fall in equilibrium with the SM particles.
%However, at some point the universe is sufficiently cool that this interaction becomes supressed and the
%number density of Dark Matter is fixed at the value we observe today; this process is known as 'freeze-out'.
As a result this means that there may be some yet unknown mechanism that couples to both Dark Matter and
Standard Model particles; this mechanism is referred to as a Dark Matter mediator.
%%%%% Note to laurie
%% => WIMP is if mediator is weak and particle is massive
%% => WIMP miracle is that freeze-out occurs at roughly right abundance with no extra work. Great news
%% => Unfortunately WIMP is starting to become very constrained (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03800.pdf)
%% => So we might need other mediator models, such as the Z'.
%\textbf{Do I need to talk about the WIMP miracle; I was going to say no as I want to talk about Z' which is not the weak force as such}

\subsubsection{Hierarchy Problem}

The Hierarchy problem is the fact that the mass scale of electro-weak breaking, ($M_{EW}\nobreak\sim\nobreak100~\text{GeV}$),
is much smaller than the mass scale of gravity,
known as the Plank scale ($M_{Plank}\nobreak\sim\nobreak10^{19}~\text{GeV}$).
This effectively means that the energy scale of the physics we see in the Standard Model is very far
from the energy scale of the next known interaction, that of gravity.

The Hierarchy problem leads to complications in theoretical calculations, such as the that of the Higgs boson mass.
When calculating the Higgs boson mass one must consider
%the bare mass of the Higgs boson from the Lagrangian in addition to
radiative contributions from additional loop diagrams,
similar to what was done for the gluon propagator in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd_dijet_running}.
However, these contributions are found to be of the order $\delta m_H^2 \sim \frac{1}{16\pi^2} M_{Plank}^2$\hspace{0.2mm},
orders of magnitude larger than the observed mass of the Higgs boson.
This means that in reality some mechanism must either cancel the contributions or reduce their size.
Whilst the parameters from the Standard Model can be chosen such that these different contributions approximately cancel out,
such fine-tuning of the parameters is hard to believe without some underlying explanation.

Instead there are two solutions typically proposed to reduce the effect of the loop corrections.
Firstly, one can introduce BSM physics such that the Standard Model contributions are cancelled by the BSM contributions.
Secondly, one can introduce some BSM physics at a new energy scale
such that the loop diagram contributions are cut off at $\delta m_H^2 \sim \frac{1}{16\pi^2} M_{BSM}^2$.
If the BSM physics is on the TeV scale then this would reduce to size of the contributions to the scale of the Higgs boson's mass,
giving some prior belief that new physics could be found at this energy scale.
%Both solutions could result in BSM physics around the TeV scale.

\subsubsection{Quarks Generational Structure}
\label{sec:theo-bsm_3g}

The quarks of the standard model have a well ordered generational symmetry;
three generations of quarks each containing a pair of $+\frac{2}{3}$ and $-\frac{1}{3}$ charged quarks.
However the generational symmetry is not perfect;
each generation is heavier than the previous one
and within the generations quarks can have different masses.
In particular, the third generation of quarks is somewhat special;
the top quark is much heavier than the bottom quark
and is the heaviest particle of the Standard Model.

There is no good explanation of why there is generational structure in the Standard Model,
why the mass hierarchy is unsymmetric 
or why the third generation has one quark with such a large mass.
The generational structure could be a result of some underlying broken symmetry
which forms a part of a deeper theory of Particle Physics.
Any deeper theory explaining the generational structure could contain observable BSM particles,
and, given the special nature of the third generation,
the BSM particles could couple strongest with the third generation of quarks.

Unlike the case of Dark Matter,
the generational structure of quarks
and the special nature of the third generation is not concrete evidence
of BSM physics.
But it does mean that there are motivations to be particularly interested in
searches for particles decaying to the third generation of quarks.

\subsection{Beyond Standard Model Theories}

The previous section discussed a list of deficiencies of the Standard Model,
which makes us confident that Beyond the Standard Model physics must exist.
This leads us to ask what the new theory of physics could be
and, crucially for an experimentalist,
how can one obtain evidence of BSM physics.

Many proposed theories of BSM physics include the addition of a new particle and,
in particular, the special nature of the third generation
\footnote{Discussed in Section~\ref{sec:theo-bsm_3g}}
means that some models of BSM predict new particles
that preferentially decay to one or two $b$-quarks.
Hence, these resonances could provide evidence of BSM physics.
Further to this, the Hierarchy Problem provides motivation to believe
that any new physics may be found at the TeV scale.

Two such models that predict resonances with preferential decays to $b$-quarks
are discussed below.
These are used as `benchmark models' in the analysis presented in this thesis,
where a benchmark model is a plausible signal model 
that is used to form and optimise a search strategy.

\subsubsection{$Z'$ Boson}

One of the most simple additions to the Standard model is that of a $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry
which would result in an additional $Z'$ boson.
An additional $U(1)'$ symmetry appears in many different BSM models and is therefore a well motivated BSM extension~\cite{theo-bsm_zprime}.
The $Z'$ model can decay to a pair of $b$-quarks, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:theo-bsm_zprime}.
%Often theses models use the breaking of some higher gauge symmetry to give $G_{SM}~\text{x}~U'(1)^n$ gauge symmetry group,
%and thus giving additional predicting the existence of new gauge bosons in addition to the Standard Model
%\footnote{$G_{SM} = SU(3)~\text{x}~SU(2)~\text{x}~U(1)$, which is the gauge symmetry group of the Standard Model discussed in Section~\ref{sec:theo-sm}}.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth, angle=0]{figs/Theory/bsm_zprime.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The leading-order Feynman diagram of the process $q\bar{q} \to Z' \to b\bar{b}$.}
  \label{fig:theo-bsm_zprime}
\end{figure}

In this thesis we will consider three different models predicting a $Z'$ boson with different couplings.
The first is known as the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) $Z'$ in which the couplings
of the new $Z'$ boson are set to match those of the Standard Model, leading to universal coupling to all fermions.
The strongest limits on the SSM $Z'$ boson at the TeV scale are set by searching for $Z'$ decaying to lepton pairs~\cite{theo-bsm_dilep}
\footnote{This is due to the fact that a di-lepton signature is distinct to the large QCD dijet backgrounds produced in $pp$ collisions}.
In addition, we also consider a leptophobic $Z'$ model that does not couple to the lepton sector
but has universal coupling to each of the quarks~\cite{theo-bsm_zprime_leptophobic},
this model is therefore not strongly constrained by di-lepton searches.

The final $Z'$ model considered acts as a Dark Matter mediator which can couple to both the Dark Matter sector and the Standard Model quark sector~\cite{theo_bsm-zprime_dm};
the motivation for such a model was discussed in Section~\ref{sec:theo_bsm_dm}.
This model introduces an additional $U(1)'$ symmetry and a Dirac fermion Dark Matter particle that only interacts through the new gauge group.
The resulting $Z'$ couples with the DM fermion and the Standard Model quark sector with coupling $g_\chi$\hspace{0.1mm} and $g_q$\hspace{0.1mm}, respectively,
and is leptophobic so does not couple with the lepton sector.

It is worth noting that the $Z'$ models considered do not preferentially decay to $b$-quarks but rather with equal branching ratio.
However, this can still be considered as preferential decay to $b$-quarks with respect to the dijet background,
which is dominated by gluons and quarks from the first two generations, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:theo-qcd_dijet}.
Furthermore, there exists $Z'$ models that do not couple to all generations equally~\cite{theo-bsm_zprime_3g},
such that a $Z'$-boson preferably decaying to $b$-quarks is possible.
%For example; attempts to merge the electro-weak and strong interactions in a so-called 'Grand Unified Theory'
%often use higher symmetries, such as $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$.

\subsubsection{Excited Third-Generation Quark}

To explain the generational and mass structure of the quark sector, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:theo-bsm_3g},
quark compositeness models describe quarks, not as fundamental particles, but instead constructed of other fundamental particles.
One consequence of quark compositeness models is the prediction of excited quarks, $q^{*}$, which can be observed as heavy resonances.

In particular we consider an excited 3rd generation quark, the $b^{*}$ quark.
The dominant decay mode of a $b^{*}$ quark is to $bg$ with a BR of 85\%
while the remaining decay modes are to $Wt$, $bZ$ and $b\gamma$ with BRs of 10\%, 4.5\% and 0.5\% respectively
\footnote{Using the assumptions outlined in~\cite{theo-bsm_bstar}.}.
A Feynman diagram showing the  dominant production and decay mode of a $b^*$ quark is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:theo-bsm_bstar}.

  %\caption{A Feynman diagram showing the dominant production and decay mode of a $b^{*}$ quark.}
  \label{fig:theo-bsm_bstar}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Model Independence}

The two benchmark models demonstrate that searching for particles decaying to one or two $b$-quarks
is well motivated.
However, it is important to note that the prior belief in any specific model of BSM is small.
This is because there are many BSM theories proposed
and there is little evidence to prefer one model over another.
In addition, one must also consider that the true theory may not have been anticipated,
such that experiments might see evidence of something truly unexpected.

Therefore, one should construct searches for BSM to be as model independent as possible,
rather than optimising specifically for any one model in particular.
In our case we want to search for any particle that is decaying to one or two
$b$-quarks, in a way such we are sensitive to as many BSM theoretical models as possible
and allow for the unexpected gifts that nature might throw up.

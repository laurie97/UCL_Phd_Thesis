\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:int}

The Standard Model is the current best description of the fundamental particles of the universe and their interactions.
However, inconsitencies within the Standard Model indicates that
there must be Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics.
Many proposed BSM models predict the existence of new particles
which preferentially decay to a pair or $b$-quarks or a $b$-quark and a gluon.
The observation of such a particle would provide crucial experimental
evidence in the development of a more complete theory of Particle Physics.

%The high-energy $pp$ collisions produced by the LHC and observed
%by the ATLAS experiment provide an opportunity to search for
%BSM phyics in unexplored regions of phase space.

BSM resonances decaying to a pair of quarks or gluons
have been searched for using pairs of hadronic jets created
by high-energy proton-proton collisions, such searches are known as inclusive dijet searches~\cite{theo-dijet_harris}.
Inclusive dijet searches have been performed in 13~TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper,dijet-mori17_paper,dijet-cms};
no evidence of a BSM resonance has yet been found.

The sensitivity of dijet searches to BSM models decaying to one or more $b$-quarks can be increased
using hadronic jets identified as containing a $B$-hadron,
which leads to a significant reduction of Standard Model backgrounds.
Such searches are know as di-$b$-jet searches.
Di-$b$-jet searches have previously been performed by
the CDF collaboration using 1.8~TeV $p\bar{p}$ collisions from the Tevatron~\cite{dibjet-cdf}
and the CMS collaboration using 8~TeV $pp$ collisions from the LHC~\cite{dibjet-cms},
no evidence of a BSM resonance was found.

Di-$b$-jet searches have been performed using the ATLAS experiment
with higher-energy proton-proton collisions than any previous \mbox{di-$b$-jet} searches,
representing a unique opportunity to search for BSM resonanances.
This thesis presents the two most recent di-$b$-jet searches performed by using
13~TeV $pp$ collision data collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector.
The first di-$b$-jet search probes the mass region 1.4-6~TeV using an integrated luminosity of 13.3~\ifb{};
the analysis has been published as a conference note~\cite{dibjet-ichep_conf}.
The second searches the mass region 0.6-1.5~TeV using an integrated luminosity of 24.5~\ifb{};
the analysis is soon to be published.

The thesis presents the di-$b$-jet search in the following structure.
Firstly, the theoretical and experimental background to the di-$b$-jet searches are discussed.

\section{Personal Contributions}

In modern experimental particle physics most research is performed as part of large collaborations,
such that the technical complications of building, running and analysing the experiments can be shared amongst many.
One such of these collabortions is the ATLAS collaboration at the LHC, comprised of over 3,000 physicists and engineers.

This thesis presents research performed between September 2014 and December 2017 carried out as part of the ATLAS collaboration.
To present the research in a complete form, the work must be presented within the context of the research carried out by the the ATLAS collaboration.
Furthermore, only the most significant contributions are presented,
such that this thesis forms a coherent and consistent document without repetition of superceded results.

For clarity, this section summarises the author's personal contributions to the research activities of the ATLAS collaboration
and highlights where these are presented in the thesis.
Futhermore, all plots that were not produced by the author contain a citation in the caption.

  I was an active memember of the $b$-tagging group between September 2014 and September 2015.

The Standard Model is the current best description of the fundamental particles of the universe and their interactions.
However, inconsistencies within the Standard Model indicate that
there must be Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics.
Many proposed BSM models predict the existence of new particles
which preferentially decay to a pair of $b$-quarks or a $b$-quark and a gluon.
The observation of such a BSM particle would provide crucial experimental
evidence in the development of a more complete theory of particle physics.

%The high-energy $pp$ collisions produced by the LHC and observed
%by the ATLAS experiment provide an opportunity to search for
%BSM phyics in unexplored regions of phase space.

One experimental technique to discover a BSM particle is to search for
the dominant resonant production of that particle using a particle collider.
Resonant production occurs when the invariant mass of the decay products is equal to the mass of the BSM particle.
The experimental signature of resonant production is known as a resonance.

Many searches for resonances of BSM particles decaying to a pair of quarks or gluons
have been performed using the invariant mass distribution of pairs of hadronic jets created
by high-energy hadron collisions~\cite{theo-dijet_harris}, such searches are known as inclusive dijet searches.
Dijet searches are particularly interesting at hadron colliders as BSM particles
that decay to quarks will be strongly produced.
Inclusive dijet searches have been performed using 13~TeV \mbox{proton--proton} ($pp$) collisions at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations;
the searches have probed the mass ranges 1.1~--~8~TeV~\cite{dijet-mori16_paper,dijet-mori17_paper,dijet-cms}
and 0.1~--~1.5~TeV~\cite{dijet-isr,dijet-TLA,dijet-isr_cms},
no evidence of a BSM resonance has yet been found.

The sensitivity of dijet searches to BSM particles decaying to one or two $b$-quarks can be increased
using $b$-jets, where a $b$-jet is a hadronic jet containing a $b$-quark.
Such searches are known as di-$b$-jet searches.
Di-$b$-jet searches have previously been performed by
the CDF collaboration using 1.8~TeV $p\bar{p}$ collisions at the Tevatron~\cite{dibjet-cdf}
and by the CMS collaboration using 8~TeV $pp$ collisions at the LHC~\cite{dibjet-cms};
no evidence of a BSM resonance was found by either collaboration.

Di-$b$-jet searches have been performed using the ATLAS experiment
with higher-energy $pp$ collisions than any previous \mbox{di-$b$-jet} search,
representing an unprecedented opportunity to search for BSM particles decaying to $b$-quarks.
This thesis presents two di-$b$-jet searches performed using
13~TeV $pp$ collision data collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector.
A high-mass di-$b$-jet search probes the mass region 1.4~--~6~TeV using an integrated luminosity of 13.3~\ifb{};
the analysis has been published as a conference note~\cite{dibjet-ichep_conf}.
A low-mass di-$b$-jet search probes the mass region 0.6~--~1.5~TeV using an integrated luminosity of 24.3~\ifb{};
the analysis is to be published soon.

For the low-mass di-$b$-jet search, real-time identification of $b$-jets is used to collect data,
this data-acquisition tool is known as the ATLAS $b$-jet trigger.
Therefore, for the low mass di-$b$-jet search, a detailed understanding of the performance of the ATLAS $b$-jet trigger is required.
The measurement of the ATLAS $b$-jet trigger efficiency in 2016 data is also presented in this thesis.

\section{Personal Contributions}

In modern experimental particle physics, most research is performed as part of large collaborations,
such that the experimental challenges of construction, operation and data-analysis can be shared amongst many.
One such of these collaborations is the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, comprised of over 3,000 physicists and engineers.

This thesis presents research performed between September 2014 and December 2017 carried out as part of the ATLAS collaboration.
To present the research in a complete form, the work must be presented within the context of the research carried out by the ATLAS collaboration.
Furthermore, only the most significant contributions of the work are presented
such that this thesis forms a coherent and consistent document without repetition or the presentation of superseded studies.

For clarity, this section summarises my personal contributions to the research activities of the ATLAS collaboration
and highlights where these are presented in the thesis.
In addition, all figures and tables that I did not produce are indicated using a citation in the caption;
only figures that I produced do not have a citation.

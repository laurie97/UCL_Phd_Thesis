Two searches for Beyond Standard Model resonances are performed                                                                                 %% 9
%decaying to a pair of $b$-quarks or a $b$-quark and a gluon are performed.                                                                     %%%%%
using 13~TeV \mbox{proton--proton} collision data collected by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016                                                 %% 16
using the invariant mass distribution of pairs of jets,                                                                                         %% 9
where at least one or both jets are identified as containing a $b$-quark.                                                                       %% 13
The searches are sensitive to resonances decaying to a pair of $b$-quarks or a $b$-quark and a gluon.                                           %% 18
A high-mass search probes the mass region 1.4~--~6~TeV using a data-set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 13.3~\ifb{}.               %% 22
A low-mass search utilises real-time $b$-jet identification to                                                                                  %% 10
probe the mass region 0.6~--~1.5~TeV using a data-set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 24.3~\ifb{}.                                 %% 18
No evidence of a resonance is found.                                                                                                            %% 7
Excited $b^*$ quarks with masses from 1.4 to 2.3~TeV and                                                                                        %% 11                        
a set of $Z'$ boson models with masses from 0.6 to 1.25~TeV or at 1.5~TeV are excluded at the 95\% credibility-level.                           %% 24
In addition, 95\% credibility-level upper limits are set on generic signals with a Gaussian shape in the mass range 0.65~--~6~TeV.               %% 20

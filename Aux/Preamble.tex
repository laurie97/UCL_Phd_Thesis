Two searches for Beyond Standard Model resonances are performed                                                                                 %%
in 13~TeV \mbox{proton--proton} collision data collected by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016                                                 %%
using the invariant mass distribution of pairs of jets,                                                                                         %% 
where at least one or both jets are identified as containing a $B$-hadron.                                                                      %% 
A high-mass search probes the mass region 1.4~--~6~TeV with an integrated luminosity of 13.3~\ifb{}.                                            %% 
A low-mass search utilises a $b$-jet trigger to probe the mass region 0.6~--~1.5~TeV with an integrated luminosity of 24.3~\ifb{}.              %% 
No evidence of a BSM resonance is found.                                                                                                        %% 
Excited $b^*$ quarks with masses from 1.4 to 2.3~TeV and                                                                                        %%                         
a set of $Z'$ boson models with masses from 0.6 to 1.25~TeV or at 1.5~TeV are excluded at the 95\% credibility-level.                           %%  
In addition 95\% credibility-level upper limits are set on generic Gaussian signals in the mass range 0.65~--~6~TeV.                            %%

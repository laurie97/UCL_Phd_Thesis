  abstract={The high luminosity of the LHC results in a significant background to interesting physics events known as pile-up. ATLAS has adopted two independent methods for modeling pile-up and its effect on analyses. The first is a bottom-up approach, using a detailed simulation of the detector to recreate each component of the pile-up background. The second uses specially recorded data events to emulate it. This article reports on the experience using both of these methods, including performance considerations, for simulating pile-up in ATLAS.}

  abstract={The ATLAS trigger system has been used very successfully for the online event selection during the LHC's first run (Run-1) between 2009 and 2013 at centre-of-mass energies (√s) between 900 GeV and 8 TeV. The trigger system consists of a hardware Level-1 (L1) and a software-based high-level trigger (HLT) that reduces the event rate from the design bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz to an average recording rate of a few hundred Hz. During the next data-taking period (Run-2) starting in early 2015, the LHC will operate at √s = 13 TeV, resulting in roughly five times higher trigger rates. We will review the upgrades to the ATLAS trigger system that have been implemented during the long shutdown and that will allow us to cope with these increased trigger rates while maintaining or even improving our efficiencies to select relevant physics processes. These include changes to the L1 calorimeter trigger, the introduction of new L1 topological trigger modules, improvements in the L1 muon system and the merging of the previous two-level HLT system into a single event-filter farm. Finally, we will summarize the commissioning status of the trigger system in view of the imminent restart of data-taking.}

  abstract={The ATLAS (one of two general purpose detectors at the LHC) Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) is the outermost of the three tracking subsystems of the ATLAS Inner Detector. It is a large straw-based detector and contains about 350,000 electronics channels. The performance of the TRT as tracking and particularly particle identification detector strongly depends on stability of the operation parameters with most important parameter being the gas gain which must be kept constant across the detector volume. The gas gain in the straws can vary significantly with atmospheric pressure, temperature, and gas mixture composition changes. This paper presents a concept of the gas gain stabilisation in the TRT and describes in detail the Gas Gain Stabilisation System (GGSS) integrated into the Detector Control System (DCS). Operation stability of the GGSS during Run-1 is demonstrated.}
